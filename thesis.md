Introduction
============

How should we as a society value changes in population size? The
question may be crucial when evaluating global warming scenarios. I
defend the intuition of neutrality, which answers a part of the
question. It states that – other things being equal – it is ethically
irrelevant whether or not additional people are added to a population.
The argument against neutrality criticizes the intuition to be
inconsistent. I present three new objections to the argument: First,
economic efficiency needs not be assumed as an ethical principle.
Second, the intuition can be interpreted consistently in terms of
uncertainty. Third, the intuition can be interpreted and justified in
contractarianism. These objections are independent from each other. They
are built on controversial philosophical views and do not necessarily
disprove the argument against neutrality. Rather, they undermine the
authority of the argument by pointing out the weakness of several
premises.

I begin by briefly introducing the framework of welfare economics, which
this essay argues within. I then present in more detail the intuition of
neutrality and the formal argument brought forward against it. The main
part is dedicated to the development of three objections to the
argument. I conclude with some remarks about the status and plausibility
of the different objections.

Exposition
==========

Welfare Economics
-----------------

Welfare economics is the theory how individual well-being should be
aggregated to general well-being (or welfare). General well-being drives
decisions in the welfare state. The theory is relevant for the execution
as well as the design of economic policies. As in democracies the
citizens and their representatives take part in the design process,
welfare economics is subject to societal discourse in these nations.
Within this discourse, citizens and media often do not only claim their
own interests. Instead they also refer to ethical principles which are
to guide democratic policy decisions. This essay is set within this
democratic discourse and aims to defend a supposedly widespread
intuition whose consistency has been challenged from the academic side.

The core of welfare economics is the welfare function (see (Harsanyi
1955, 309), Harsanyi 1955, p. 309). It is an aggregation function: a
function which takes in the individual levels of well-being of several
individual persons,  and delivers the level of welfare for the whole
aggregated population comprising these individual persons. Well-being
and welfare (which refers to aggregated well-being) are abstract terms.
They are usually interpreted as a representation of preferences over
different lives. But they can also be interpreted simply as hedonistic
levels of lifetime pleasure, which will be sufficient for the purpose of
this essay. Well-being (or utility) of a person p is denoted by u(p);
individual persons are denoted by pi – the subscript is just there to
differentiate between different persons. In similar fashion, welfare of
a population P = { p1, p2, …, pn } is denoted by u(P).

  Definition 1: Welfare function

The content of the general welfare function is intentionally
unspecified. The function is just a vehicle for discussion within
welfare economics. Several specific welfare functions have been proposed
and we will deal with some of them in later sections. For example, the
classical utilitarian welfare function states that welfare is simply the
sum u(p1) + u(p2) + … + u(pn) of all individual well-being.

I introduce these welfare functions because they are precise
formalizations of competing ethical beliefs. In the first two
objections, I will make use of them in order to demonstrate that when we
assume certain ethical intuitions, the argument against neutrality does
not hold. I will assume various widespread competing beliefs – average
utilitarianism, the difference principle, and the median principle – and
try to refute the argument against neutrality from each of these views.
The idea is that many people will adhere to one of these principles so
that they can agree with at least one of the refutations. The third
objection is of a different kind because, rather than to the various
beliefs about welfare functions, it relates to their justification.

Welfare economics are blind in a certain respect, and so will be this
discussion: They are consequentialist. This means that they only
evaluate actions by their outcome and in this context specifically by
their impact on general welfare or goodness. Other elements of ethical
evaluation, such as the procedural requirements of justice, will have to
be considered separately (cf. <span id="ref:RNDcQ2WyYJ8nc"
label="ref:RNDcQ2WyYJ8nc">\[ref:RNDcQ2WyYJ8nc\]</span>Broome 2005, p.
401; <span id="ref:RNDc3AhfEFA9H"
label="ref:RNDc3AhfEFA9H">\[ref:RNDc3AhfEFA9H\]</span>Broome 2012, p.
99f). These separate considerations will often require consequentialist
considerations as their basis, so this discussion may also be indirectly
relevant for them.

The intuition of neutrality
---------------------------

The intuition of neutrality is assumed to be a widespread ethical
intuition among humans (<span id="ref:RND5BNnNe71j8"
label="ref:RND5BNnNe71j8">\[ref:RND5BNnNe71j8\]</span>Broome 2012, p.
176f). The content of the intuition is also called the principle of
equal existence (<span id="ref:RNDaWHBLx2kgv"
label="ref:RNDaWHBLx2kgv">\[ref:RNDaWHBLx2kgv\]</span>Broome 2004, p.
146). The following is the content of the definition: Let us assume two
hypothetical scenarios A and B. The same people exist in both scenarios,
except that in scenario B there are some additional people which do not
exist in scenario A. The intuition says that which one of the scenarios
is better depends entirely on the well-being of the people who exist in
both scenarios and not at all on the additional people who only exist in
B – as long as all the additional people in B have a well-being within a
certain neutral range. More specifically, as long as the additional
people in B are within the neutral range, scenario A is better in terms
of welfare if the people who exist in both populations have a higher
welfare in scenario A, and scenario B is better in terms of welfare if
the people who exist in both populations have a higher welfare in
scenario B.

We can formalize the scenarios as different welfare distributions uA and
uB. Let P0 be a population of people who exist in both scenarios but
need not have the same levels of well-being in both scenarios. Let P+ be
the population of people who exist only in scenario B. Let \[u1, u2\] be
the neutral range of well-being for added people.

Definition 2: The intuition of neutrality

This formal definition is to be interpreted in the following way: It
does not matter in terms of welfare whether there exists an additional
person in the population who lives at a moderate level of well-being.
There are several moderate levels of well-beings, which form a range
between a low moderate level of well-being u1 and a high moderate level
of well-being u2. If however the additional person is at a very low
level of well-being – below u1 – then the person might matter for the
calculation of general well-being. (Arguably, the welfare would decrease
because of the added person; though this is not specified by the
intuition.) Similarly, if the additional person is at a very high level
of well-being – above u2 – then the person might matter for the
calculation of general well-being. (Arguably, the welfare would increase
because of the added person.)

An exemplary application of the intuition is the evaluation of road
safety (<span id="ref:RNDiZrz5y32ax"
label="ref:RNDiZrz5y32ax">\[ref:RNDiZrz5y32ax\]</span>Broome 2004, p.
144f). In this context, the deaths of people dying in accidents must be
weighed against the costs of preventing them. Whilst this is an
ethically difficult problem on its own, one important long-term effect
is usually left aside: The well-being of the expected potential
offspring of the potentially dying person is completely neglected. One
possible justification is the intuition of neutrality: We can expect the
offspring to live within the neutral range of well-being and it is
therefore neither positive nor negative whether they exist or not.

Another example is the evaluation of different scenarios of global
warming (<span id="ref:RNDoULCN0LnjP"
label="ref:RNDoULCN0LnjP">\[ref:RNDoULCN0LnjP\]</span>Broome 2012, p.
170). Global warming is likely to kill many people and thereby to
prevent their offspring from existing. On the other hand, global warming
may increase poverty, which is associated with higher birth rates.
Thanks to the intuition of neutrality we can simply leave both of these
effects aside in many of our evaluations – which comes handy as
predictions in these domains attend to an enormous amount of
uncertainty.

It is important to understand that the intuition of neutrality does not
imply neutrality about the consequences on the existing population which
are caused by the additional population. These consequences may be
negative or positive, leading to contrary political reactions such as
China’s restrictive one-child-policy and Europe’s reproduction-promoting
policy (<span id="ref:RNDXP2aYAu98y"
label="ref:RNDXP2aYAu98y">\[ref:RNDXP2aYAu98y\]</span>Broome 2012, p.
169). The consequences on the existing population may well determine
whether additional people are good or not. Only the well-being of the
additional people themselves does not do so according to the intuition
of neutrality.

The question whether the intuition of neutrality is in fact a widespread
intuition among humans appears not to have been investigated. It is not
necessary for the argument against neutrality to assume such an
empirical fact. Neither is it necessary for the refutation of this
argument to assume so. If however this refutation were successful and
the integrity of the intuition thus restored, then it would be desirable
to investigate the empirical prevalence of the intuition.

The argument against neutrality
-------------------------------

The argument against neutrality (<span id="ref:RNDVrb2Fg6EjX"
label="ref:RNDVrb2Fg6EjX">\[ref:RNDVrb2Fg6EjX\]</span>Broome 2012, p.
177f., where the figure below is also copied from) concludes that the
intuition of neutrality is inconsistent. The argument is a version of
the mere addition paradox (<span id="ref:RNDn8ybKRhpdp"
label="ref:RNDn8ybKRhpdp">\[ref:RNDn8ybKRhpdp\]</span>Broome 2004, p.
148) and a modification of the adoption problem (<span
id="ref:RND0coQvEEBxt"
label="ref:RND0coQvEEBxt">\[ref:RND0coQvEEBxt\]</span>Broome 2004, p.
161). It is based on the following counter-example to the intuition of
neutrality:

<img src="3-fig-1" style="width:80.0%" alt="image" />

There are three scenarios A, B and C. They share the same population,
except that one additional person exists in both B and C. In both B and
C the additional person has a level of well-being within the neutral
range. The argument is structured into two major steps:

First, scenario A is being compared to scenario B and to scenario C. The
additional person can be neglected in this step because the person is
within the neutral range. There is one person who is a little bit better
off in scenario B than in scenario A. As all other persons have exactly
the same level of well-being, it is reasonable that there is a higher
welfare in scenario B than in scenario A. Contrarily, there is one
person who is a little bit worse off in scenario C than in scenario A.
As all other persons have exactly the same level of well-being, it is
reasonable that there is a higher welfare in scenario A than in scenario
C. As a consequence of these two observations, scenario B has a higher
welfare than scenario C. Technically, this conclusion requires
transitivity of the betterness relation.

Second, scenario B is compared directly to scenario C. Both scenarios
comprise the same people, so there is no additional person in either
scenario who could be neglected. The person who is not present in
scenario A and has therefore been neglected above is much better off in
scenario C than in scenario B. This big difference clearly outweighs the
difference of the other person’s well-being in favour of scenario B. As
there is moreover a higher equality in scenario C, scenario C obviously
has a higher welfare than scenario B. This is in contradiction to the
result of step one, so the counter-example refutes the intuition of
neutrality, which has been its core assumption.

Whilst the argument above is intuitively plausible, it has two other
important premises (<span id="ref:RNDcNWwD0bGcJ"
label="ref:RNDcNWwD0bGcJ">\[ref:RNDcNWwD0bGcJ\]</span>Broome 2012, p.
177f): First, if in two scenarios all persons have the same level of
well-being except for one person who is better off in the second
scenario, then the welfare in the second scenario is higher than in the
first. Technically, the second scenario Pareto dominates the first
(<span id="ref:RNDe8Jgwq2mlh"
label="ref:RNDe8Jgwq2mlh">\[ref:RNDe8Jgwq2mlh\]</span>Osborne 1997).
Second, if in two scenarios with the same population the sum of
individual well-being is higher in the second scenario, and at the same
time the inequality of the distribution of well-being is lower in the
second scenario, then the second scenario is better in terms of welfare
than the first. I call this the fair aggregation principle. There are
various ways to measure inequality, and the details need not concern us
here. An excellent survey of one-dimensional inequality measures – as
applied in welfare economics – is given in <span id="ref:RNDgO1lcEIWbu"
label="ref:RNDgO1lcEIWbu">\[ref:RNDgO1lcEIWbu\]</span>Sen & Foster 1997.
The most prominent inequality measure is probably the Gini coefficient
(see <span id="ref:RNDJkmhvOr2SL"
label="ref:RNDJkmhvOr2SL">\[ref:RNDJkmhvOr2SL\]</span>Ceriani & Verme
2012). Both of these premises appear to be very plausible, and they are
dubbed “hard-to-doubt assumptions” in <span id="ref:RNDUBSa4lnZMJ"
label="ref:RNDUBSa4lnZMJ">\[ref:RNDUBSa4lnZMJ\]</span>Broome 2012, p.
176.

The following formalization concisely sums up the argument presented
above. It is structured in technical premises (P...), the assumptions
that make up the setting of the counter-example (A...), and the
conclusions drawn (C...). We can infer from the contradiction in (C8)
that at least one of the premises and assumptions must be false. The
assumptions merely describe the setting of the scenarios as depicted in
the figure above. They are simply the assumptions making up the
counter-example and there is no reason to doubt them within this proof.
Moreover, premises (P2) and (P3) appear to be very plausible. As a
consequence, the intuition of neutrality must be the false premise.

Proof 1: The argument against neutrality

There are two implications if this argument holds and the intuition of
neutrality is inconsistent (cf. <span id="ref:RNDvHVBymXoLa"
label="ref:RNDvHVBymXoLa">\[ref:RNDvHVBymXoLa\]</span>Broome 2005, p.
411): First, we as a society would have to develop a different,
consistent principle to replace the intuition. We do not even currently
know whether population changes should be evaluated as positive or as
negative, just that they cannot simply be evaluated as neutral. The
finding of a new principle with wide acceptance would certainly present
a major societal task and require many years of discourse. Second, we
would need to gain better knowledge of which actions lead to which
consequences with respect to population changes. Only then would we
probably be able to apply a principle which is not based on neutrality.
This requires new scientific analysis and simulation because such
predictions have often been omitted in the past (<span
id="ref:RND54So3qk8SK"
label="ref:RND54So3qk8SK">\[ref:RND54So3qk8SK\]</span>Broome 2005, p.
402; <span id="ref:RNDJG5XuCbvIG"
label="ref:RNDJG5XuCbvIG">\[ref:RNDJG5XuCbvIG\]</span>Broome 2012, p.
115f).

<span id="ref:RNDoGhae544eI"
label="ref:RNDoGhae544eI">\[ref:RNDoGhae544eI\]</span>Broome 2004
develops five possible modifications to respond to the argument against
neutrality (see p. 149):

1.  intransitivity of the betterness relation

2.  conditional goodness

3.  relative goodness

4.  indeterminacy or vagueness of the betterness relation

5.  a single neutral level

The transitivity of the betterness relation is plausibly defended in
<span id="ref:RNDLa97xVELwW"
label="ref:RNDLa97xVELwW">\[ref:RNDLa97xVELwW\]</span>Broome 2004, p.
151f. I will pursue a somewhat related approach to (b) and (c), focused
more on justification, in the third objection. The second objection will
be very similar to what is developed in (d) but it will also be
compatible with (e). Whilst (P1) is discussed in (a), (P2) and (P3) have
not been discussed so far. This is what I will do in the first
objection.

Analysis
========

Objection 1: Aggregation contradicts justice
--------------------------------------------

I will start by delivering some general criticism on Pareto domination
and aggregation and then continue to examine their relation to
justice-oriented welfare functions.

When we say that a scenario Pareto dominates another scenario, we mean
that at least one person is better off in this scenario than in the
other while all other persons are at an equal level of well-being. The
Pareto principle I have formulated as (P2) says that in such cases the
scenario has a higher welfare than the other one. This principle, as
well as the extending requirement of Pareto efficiency (cf. <span
id="ref:RND8Hv7yXwRou"
label="ref:RND8Hv7yXwRou">\[ref:RND8Hv7yXwRou\]</span>Osborne 1997),
find their due place in economics where the objective is the efficient
allocation of scarce resources (<span id="ref:RNDutDkBfheMg"
label="ref:RNDutDkBfheMg">\[ref:RNDutDkBfheMg\]</span>Samuelson &
Nordhaus 2010, p. 4). However I doubt that they are suitable as ethical
principles. Pareto efficiency has been criticized because the liberal
paradox suggests that it may be incompatible with procedural elements of
liberalism (see <span id="ref:RNDiYsz4NL9rY"
label="ref:RNDiYsz4NL9rY">\[ref:RNDiYsz4NL9rY\]</span>Sen & Foster
1997). But I believe that there is a more general problem with Pareto
efficiency and even with Pareto domination: Consider a large population
with one person whose well-being is much higher than the well-being of
the others. Is it ethically desirable – is there a higher welfare – if
the welll-being of this person is increased even more, while the
well-being of the other persons remains the same? This can be
intuitively doubted, and below I show some mildly convincing reasoning
in favour of this intuition (doubt?).

A similar criticism applies to what I have called the fair aggregation
principle. The fair aggregation principle is a combination of what I
call the simple aggregation principle – that general welfare is the
simple sum of all individual well-being – with the additional
requirement that distributions need be more equal to have a higher
welfare. The principle is non-exhaustive: it does not tell us anything
about populations with a higher sum of well-being and a lower equality,
and it does not tell us anything about populations with a lower sum of
well-being and a higher equality. But that is not a problem, since such
populations do not play a relevant role in the counter-example to
neutrality.

The problem (for what?) is that equality must reasonably be a global
criterion, which means that it somehow takes into account the well-being
of every single person. This implies that a small decrease *ε* in
well-being of the person who already is worst off can always be
compensated by some large increase of equality within the rest of the
population. This follows because otherwise the well-being of the
worst-off person would completely determine the equality – which is not
the idea of inequality measures (vs. justice measures?).

(structure: intro, e vs f, e vs d) Now imagine three scenarios, all with
the same people: In scenario D there is some utility distribution with
lots of inequality. The person who is worst off in scenario D is called
p. In scenario E, the well-being of the worst-off person from scenario D
is decreased by some very small amount *ε*. As we have just seen, this
can be compensated in terms of equality by improving the equality within
all the other persons to a more or less drastical amount. Let us assume
this has taken place, so that the overall equality in scenario E is
higher than in scenario D. Let us further assume that in scenario F all
people are at the same level of well-being, plus
$\\frac{\\varepsilon } 2$. The general equality has not decreased (maybe
even increased) in F in comparison to E. However the sum of well-being
has increased because the well-being of many persons has been increased
by $\\frac{\\varepsilon } 2$  while the well-being of only one person
has been decreased by $\\frac{\\varepsilon } 2$. As a consequence, both
the sum of individual well-being and the equality are better in F than
in D, so according to the fair aggregation principle there is a higher
welfare in F than in D. At the same time, the worst-off person in D is
even worse off in F. This seems intuitively implausible and I will soon
(now?) give a more elaborate account of this implausibility.

STRUCTURE!!! 1. pareto stuff, 2. fair aggregation

For this objection I will use as a specific welfare function the
difference principle. The difference principle is a concept which is
inferred from an analysis of justice. Its justification as the second
principle of justice is given and discussed in <span
id="ref:RNDaX1kFAqXc5"
label="ref:RNDaX1kFAqXc5">\[ref:RNDaX1kFAqXc5\]</span>Rawls 2005, pp.
3-183. Rivalling average utilitarianism, the difference principle is
probably the most prominent and most widely accepted welfare function.
In its core formula, the difference principle states that differences
from socioeconomic equality are only permitted if they are to the
benefit of the least advantaged (<span id="ref:RND4PXINhR0Cj"
label="ref:RND4PXINhR0Cj">\[ref:RND4PXINhR0Cj\]</span>Rawls 2005, p.
302). This is equivalent to optimizing the status of the least
advantaged. The difference principle is therefore usually translated to
a welfare function where general welfare is determined only by the
well-being of the group with the lowest level of well-being. (Such
translation commits a major error in ignoring the difference between
primary goods and well-being as I discuss in <span
id="ref:RNDxfDrFqEWzs"
label="ref:RNDxfDrFqEWzs">\[ref:RNDxfDrFqEWzs\]</span>Pomerenke 2017,
p.12f. – But this does not bear upon the reasoning here, which is based
solely on Pareto comparisons.) Whilst the difference principle refers to
the least advantaged group – which makes sense in application – there is
no mistake in referring to the least advantaged person for the sake of
theory. Because of its resemblance to the decision-theoretic rule of
minimum maximization, this formulation of the principle has also been
called the Maximin rule. (Although this labelling has been rightly
criticized in <span id="ref:RND4jKuJkTAlW"
label="ref:RND4jKuJkTAlW">\[ref:RND4jKuJkTAlW\]</span>Rawls & Kelly
2001, p. 43.)

Definition 3: Difference principle / “Maximin”

w(P) = minp∈P u(p)

According to the difference principle in its Maximin version, both
Pareto domination and fair aggregation are false: Imagine that one
person who is not the worst-off in either scenario is better off in the
first scenario than in the second while all other persons are equally
well off. Then Pareto domination requires that the first scenario has a
higher welfare. The Maximin rule, however, states that both scenarios
have the same welfare because the well-being of the worst-off person has
not changed. And we have seen above that as a consequence of fair
aggregation a scenario may be evaluated as having a higher welfare even
if the worst-off person is even worse off – in strict contradiction to
the difference principle.

But the difference principle in its Maximin formulation has been
designed with the practical idea in mind that there will seldom or never
be a comparison in which the least advantaged will have the exactly same
level of well-being in both scenarios. Yet for the theoretical case of a
such comparison (unclear why we need it; it is not the case in the above
example!) an extension to the Maximin rule has been developed (cf. <span
id="ref:RNDsnmRiHk1LE"
label="ref:RNDsnmRiHk1LE">\[ref:RNDsnmRiHk1LE\]</span>Rawls 2005, p.
83): It says that in the case that the least advantaged are at the same
level in both scenarios, the second-least advantaged must be regarded.
And if the second-least advantaged are also at the same level, then the
third-least advantaged must be regarded, and so on. Because it resembles
a lexicographical sorting algorithm, the extended rule is called the
Leximin rule. It is most clearly formulated as a recursive selection
function which outputs the better population of two populations whose
members are sorted in ascending order according to their well-being:

\[Warning: Draw object ignored\]Definition 4: Difference principle /
“Leximin” selection function

We can easily observe that – unlike the Maximin rule – the Leximin rule
is compatible with Pareto domination: If all persons are equal in two
scenarios except one who is better off in the second scenario, then the
Leximin algorithm will proceed from the least advantaged person up to
the person in question. Alternatively, it will proceed up to the person
who has taken the original person’s place in the ordering, because the
original person has moved up a few positions in the ordering. This
process automatically ensures Pareto domination. So at a second glance
at the difference principle, it does not contradict but indeed rather
support Pareto domination. This is in favour of the argument against
neutrality.

The same, however, cannot be said of fair aggregation. We have seen
above that fair aggregation in some cases evaluates distributions as
being better even though the worst-off person is worse off. In such a
case, the Leximin algorithm would stop in the first iteration and amount
to the Maximin rule. The algorithm would not regard the improved
well-being of all the other persons, because not only the Maximin rule
but also the Leximin rule deem all general improvements irrelevant if
they are to the disadvantage of the least advantaged. So for one major
welfare function the “hard-to-doubt” premise of fair aggregation (P4) is
false and the argument against neutrality cannot succeed.

Objection 2: The neutral range is a single neutral level (with uncertainty)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Überleitung, Rawls -&gt; avg utilitarianism

I will start by explaining how the argument against neutrality requires
the neutral range to be a proper range rather than a single level.
Afterwards, I will try to make plausible why we should rather assume a
single neutral level in theory and elucidate how, taking uncertainty
into account, this single neutral level may approach a proper neutral
range in practice.

So far, the formalization of the intuition of neutrality involves a
neutral range \[u1, u2\] without specifying u1 or u2. As per Def. 2, the
neutral range could in fact just be a single number with u1 = u2. But
the argument against neutrality interprets the intuition of neutrality
in a way that does not permit that the neutral range is just a single
level of well-being: In order to neutralize and counter the positive
difference of well-being of person p between scenarios B and C, the
difference of well-being of person q must be non-zero and negative. So
the neutral range must allow for such a difference, because the
well-being of q is to be within the neutral range:

Even if the intuition of neutrality in this form empirically holds as a
widespread intuition, it is still theoretically problematic. One of its
implications is for example that we cannot say that a scenario with many
added people at the highest well-being within the neutral range is
better than a scenario with many added people at the lowest level of
well-being. This implication – that well-being within the neutral range
is incomparable – is at least controversial. But there are more pressing
theoretical questions: What values should u1 and u2 assume? Imagine
someone proposed as a specification that u1 should be at the level of
well-being of the person at the top of the lowest 10% in terms of
well-being. How should we respond? How should we know whether that is
correct? What kind of arguments would we have to employ in order to
plead for a higher or lower value? What kind of ethical principle
determines the range?

These problems do not arise if we restrict the intuition of neutrality
to a single level of neutral well-being: (structure???) On the one hand,
this would directly invalidate the argument against neutrality and
circumvent the problem of the incomparability of people within the
neutral range which I have just touched upon. On the other hand, there
exists an established ethical theory which justifies the existence of
this level and explains what value it should take. The theory is average
utilitarianism and one kind of justification for it is found in <span
id="ref:RNDwOOuENjFv9"
label="ref:RNDwOOuENjFv9">\[ref:RNDwOOuENjFv9\]</span>Harsanyi 1955.
Average utilitarianism is a highly controversial theory, specifically
but not only when it is understood as a complete moral theory rather
than only a theory of goodness (cf. <span id="ref:RND9Y2Bm9Fcuq"
label="ref:RND9Y2Bm9Fcuq">\[ref:RND9Y2Bm9Fcuq\]</span>Broome 2012, pp.

label="ref:RNDyIVTex1fnq">\[ref:RNDyIVTex1fnq\]</span>Rawls 2005, pp.
167-175, 572f). But at least it is a consistent ethical theory which is
not only able to account for many other ethical intuitions but also to
answer our quantitative and justificatory questions regarding the
neutral level of well-being. The welfare function of average
utilitarianism states that general welfare is the average of all
individual well-being:

Definition 5: Average utilitarianism

w(P) = ∑p∈P u(p) P-1

This implies that in order to be neutral to existing welfare, the
welfare of an added population must equal the welfare of the existing
population. The notation is a bit sloppy in the following. It should be
additionally specified that not every single added person needs to be at
this neutral level, but rather the average of all added persons needs to
be at this level.

Definition 6: The neutral range in average utilitarianism

\[u1, u2\]  = u1 = u2  = u0 = w(P)

So average utilitarianism provides a response to the argument against
neutrality by modifying the intuition of neutrality and assuming a
neutral level instead of a neutral range. As a result, the intuition is
consistent, calculable, and maybe even justified (is the latter
investigated here or without scope). Average utilitarianism plays (in
this case) a revisionist role, a theory of moral error (cf. <span
id="ref:RNDPRdjZzChhe"
label="ref:RNDPRdjZzChhe">\[ref:RNDPRdjZzChhe\]</span>Mackie 1979, p.
35): It tells us to slightly adjust our intuition – to sharpen it – so
that it is consistent in itself and in its relation to other moral
judgments. This is an acceptable, maybe desirable intervention to our
intuitions.

Furthermore, this theoretical sharpening would not even necessarily
change our application of the intuition of neutrality. This is because
in practice, uncertainties are attached to all quantities of well-being,
specifically the neutral value. When I talk of ‘uncertainty’ here, then
I refer to ‘measurement uncertainty’ as used in statistics and the
quantitative sciences. The uncertainty in question is quantifiable, so
in it falls into the decision-theoretic category of risk and not into
the decision-theoretic category of uncertainty. Measurement uncertainty
is a well-developed theory (see <span id="ref:RND01V7wRHfk9"
label="ref:RND01V7wRHfk9">\[ref:RND01V7wRHfk9\]</span>Runge 2007).
Unlike the approaches of introducing indeterminacy in the forms of
incommensurateness or vagueness – which are pursued and discarded as a
solution to the argument against neutrality in <span
id="ref:RNDOSiB2XiJlM"
label="ref:RNDOSiB2XiJlM">\[ref:RNDOSiB2XiJlM\]</span>Broome 2004, pp.
164-183 – uncertainty does not suffer from difficult problems such as
greediness (aha what does that mean? explain it shortly?).

The neutral value is affected by two kinds of uncertainty: The first
kind of uncertainty arises from its definition. Sensitivity analysis of
Def. 5 tells us that the uncertainty of the neutral level is composed of
the average uncertainty of the well-being of all existing people.
Second, the level of well-being of any actual person that is considered
to be at the neutral level or not is also subject to some uncertainty.
In both cases, the uncertainty arises from the difficulty to quantify
the personal well-being of existing or hypothetical persons. These
uncertainties are not on a theoretical level. On the theoretical level
it has been questioned that such quantifications are metaphysically and
psychologically possible at all (cf. <span id="ref:RNDA24nrQa53E"
label="ref:RNDA24nrQa53E">\[ref:RNDA24nrQa53E\]</span>Harsanyi 1955, pp.
317-319). On the practical level, these quantifications are de facto
happening (<span id="ref:RNDPDFrWFZort"
label="ref:RNDPDFrWFZort">\[ref:RNDPDFrWFZort\]</span>Broome 2004, ch.
9) but there is a great level of uncertainty attached to them (elaborate
on thisin two three sents? its interesting).

Person q from Proof 1 is at different levels in scenario A and B. We can
interpret the neutral range as a neutral level u0 = u1 + (u2 - u1) / 2
with an uncertainty of *σ*(u0) = plusmins (u2 - u1) / 2. As a
consequence, the different values of well-being for person q in
scenarios A and B are compatible with the assumption that there is a
single neutral level with u0 with an uncertainty of *σ*(u0).

We can then accept the theoretical notion of a neutral level while at
the same time both maintaining the practical idea of the intuition of
neutrality and avoiding the argument against neutrality. (point to
above, that the argument requires a proper range!)

Is doing so just a sophisticated trick? No. The specific nature of the
intuition of neutrality had not been analysed before. It was a bit rash
to conclude from the rough idea of the intuition of neutrality that it
has to be formalized as a proper range. I have explained that there is
at least no obvious possibility of justifying such a range, and that as
a consequence we do not know how to quantify the range. Average
utilitarianism presents a possible justification for a neutral level,
and together with uncertainty it can justify something like a range.
Maybe this formal interpretation is even closer to the original
intuition of neutrality than the interpretation as a real range is. If
it is not, there are many reasons that we should adjust our intuition.

Objection 3: Populations act upon their own interests / are selfish
-------------------------------------------------------------------

make clear in which case this matters: neither rawls nor avg util – also
zb was?

während bei (2) der neutral range auf eine zahl verengt wird, wird er in
(3) ausgedehnt, sodass alles neutral ist

The difference principle and average utilitarianism are probably the two
most prominent welfare functions. In both of them the argument against
neutrality does not hold for different reasons. Yet, although these
frameworks are so well received, they both suffer from a justificatory
problem. The specific justificatory problem which matters in our context
is that the frameworks assume a universal moral domain. This means that
they assume that in the first place every person should receive moral
consideration. The universal domain is what I will question in this
objection and it will lead to another solution of (response to) the
argument against neutrality.

So far we have interpreted the intuition of neutrality as a principle
which is applied only in a particular instance of comparing the welfare
of two scenario: Whenever there are additional persons in one scenario
who do not exist in the other scenario, then we can apply the intuition
of neutrality. This is reflected in the conclusions in Proof 1. In (C3)
and (C4) we have used the intuition of neutrality because there is a
different number of persons in scenario A than there is in scenarios B
and C. But we have not used the intuition in (C7) because we have been
comparing scenarios B and C, and these scenarios have the same number of
persons: “B and C contain the very same five people, so in comparing
their values all five count as existing people.” (<span
id="ref:RNDdoGn25412e"
label="ref:RNDdoGn25412e">\[ref:RNDdoGn25412e\]</span>Broome 2012,
p.177; this has been marked as potentially problematic in a talk with
Stefan Fischer.)

A simple solution to the argument against against neutrality is to deny
that in such cases all people count as existing people. If we regard
person q (the person who exists in scenarios B and C only) as
non-existent, then we cannot derive that C is better than B by direct
comparison (C7), and the argument fails: (explain ‘ notation briefly)

This requires a revised version of the intuition of neutrality (P1). The
only thing which is different from Def. 2 is that the intuition has been
extended to comparisons of scenarios where the number of persons is the
same: (very unclear! there is no numbers in the formula)

Definition 7: The intuition of neutrality (revised)

But while this solution is compelling so far, it brings with it a formal
problem. Thus far, we have not really needed to specify P0 and P+ any
more than what is implicit in Def. 2: P0 is the population which exists
in both scenarios and P+ is the population which exists only in scenario
B. This is no longer implicit in Def. 7: P0 and P+ both exist in both
scenarios. (this should probs go before the definition) There is no
formal way to distinguish them. P+ are the people who are neutral with
respect to general welfare if their well-being lies within the neutral
range. And P+ are the same people in B and in C. But P+ could be any
persons: P+ could be all persons, no persons, or an arbitrary selection
of persons. So as they are not already formally specified we need to
specify P+. It is obvious how we specify them:

  Definition 8: Additional specification of the intuition of neutrality

  P0 are the existing people and P+ are the non-existing people.

Unlike all the formal definitions above, this is a material definition,
which is not a problem. The problem is that it is also a relative
definition. Which people are existing and which are not depends on the
time of evaluation. When we consider whether it is good or not that a
baby is born, we arrive at different evaluations before and after the
pregnancy of the baby’s parent. Before the pregnancy, the baby’s
well-being has to be ignored because of the intuition of neutrality, but
after the pregnancy, the baby’s well-being has to be considered. Imagine
that we want to know whether it is positive or negative for the general
welfare whether the baby suffers from a chronic disease. Then before the
pregnancy we will derive that the chronic disease is neutral with
respect to general welfare and after the pregnancy we will derive that
it would be better for general welfare if the baby does not suffer from
a such disease (is better / would have been better).

More formally, the evaluation of welfare depends on what scenario we use
as a base scenario based on which we judge which persons are existent
and which are not. Such a base scenario may be either of the scenarios
which we compare, or a third scenario. In the case of the argument of
neutrality, we need to choose scenario A as our base scenario so that we
can arrive at the alternative conclusion (C8’).

  (P5’)  A is the base scenario,     uA is the distribution of
well-being of the base scenario.

So, to be more precise, I revise (C8’) and include (P5’) as a premise:

(C8’)  (C7’) ∧ (P1) ∧ (P5’)  ⇒  uB(P0 ∪ P+) &gt; uC(P0 ∪ P+)

A similar approach (how is it different?) to this relativism \[in what
sense?\] is pursued in <span id="ref:RNDLLbEezdHvh"
label="ref:RNDLLbEezdHvh">\[ref:RNDLLbEezdHvh\]</span>Broome 2004, pp.
157-162. There it is discarded for two reasons: First, because of the
inconsistencies which arise when switching the base scenario (pp.
68-76). Second, because of the difficulty to ethically justify
person-relativity or community-relativity (p. 161f). I will now address
both issues.

The problem of inconsistency cannot be denied: If ethical evaluations of
welfare depend on the choice of the base scenario and if every person
chooses the person’s own situation as the base scenario, inconsistencies
will arise. Principally, there are inconsistencies of several kinds. One
person could contradict another person from the same population. As we
are concerned with population ethics here, where persons will usually
somehow consider the whole population for their evaluation, this is not
necessarily a problem. A necessary problem is the time-dependence of the
evaluation, which is pointed out in <span id="ref:RND8yvQ79TSk8"
label="ref:RND8yvQ79TSk8">\[ref:RND8yvQ79TSk8\]</span>Broome 2004, p.
75: “You choose rightly, but it later turns out you chose wrongly.
Indeed, it may turn out that you ought later to undo what you rightly
did. Moreover, you might be able to foresee even as you choose A that
just this would happen. This is a most implausible sort of incoherence
in your activity.” This sounds like a problem at first, but in fact it
is well acceptable.

(one WEAK possible objection is the idea that) There is no such thing as
inconsistency between actions. (This needs SEP backing!!) Such a concept
exists of course symbolically, and for example when two persons or one
person act out two actions which appear to follow opposite intentions,
we might say that the actions are inconsistent. But the concept is very
fuzzy and the existing theory of rationality does not provide a
criterion for identifying inconsistent actions. What the theory of
rationality does provide, is a criterion for identifying inconsistent
beliefs: Beliefs are inconsistent if their propositions are
contradictory. Without a formal theory of inconsistent actions,
philosophers should probably restrict themselves to the analysis of
inconsistent beliefs, not actions. (not yet, but why couldn’t there be
one?) The underlying beliefs are complex: Before the action A, we think
that we should do A. And we think that as a causal effect of doing A, we
will regret having done A. So we think that we should do A, and that we
will regret it afterwards. After the action A, we think that we should
not have done A. We also think that we have thought that we should do A.
There is no formal contradiction in these beliefs. It may very well be
rational to think A at the moment and to expect that oneself would think
the opposite of A under different circumstances. As the enactment of A
causes a change of circumstances, the above beliefs may come about, and
there is nothing wrong with them. There is also no such thing as a
problem of “undoing” an action in philosophical terms. A is done within
one set of circumstances and then within another set of circumstances is
“undone”. The two actions of “doing A” and “undoing A” can be
differentiated by the fact that they have taken place within different
contexts (one context without the causal effects of A and one context
with the causal effects of A). There is no reason to ignore the contexts
of the actions and to strip them down to the notions of “doing A” and
“undoing A”.

Let us examine two examples where we ignore any ethical constraints and
just consider the consistency of their beliefs. Imagine a community of
two persons who reason whether or not they should improve some genetic
condition of their child. They may be concerned about the well-being of
the family and think: “Our family is rather against this for religious
reasons. Once the child is born, it will clearly prefer that the
modification had taken place. Our family will then have to respect the
preferences of the child. As a result, our family will think that the
modification should have taken place; and if it will not have taken
place, our family will probably be very unhappy about it.” The parents
in their situation of reasoning should then consider whether they want
to experience this later unhappiness. But there is no rule of
rationality which would require them to somehow align the present and
future preferences of the family. After all, the family will consist of
different persons after the child is born. As a second example, imagine
a direct democracy called Alphaland whose citizens consider – because of
their liberal ideal – to invade and annex an autocratic country called
Betaland with a population bigger than their own population. They
consensually adopt a resolution: “Alphaland wants to annex Betaland.
Alphaland expects Betaland to condemn the violence related to the
annexation. As the current citizens of Betaland will be the majority in
Alphaland after the annexation, we expect that Alphaland will officially
regret the annexation afterwards. But we expect that most former
Betaland citizens will nonetheless want to remain in Alphaland for
pragmatic reasons (so there is no reason against the action).”
Rationality does not require present Alphaland to consider the interest
future Alphaland. After all, future Alphaland is made up of different
citizens than present Alphaland. These examples illustrate that there is
no requirement for communities to be consistent with their beliefs and
expected beliefs over time. (Whether this principle also applies to
individual agents is up for discussion, but luckily needs not concern us
here.)

hier deutlicher das problem auspointen: communities erscheinen, zb weil
sie namen haben, wie menschen. dabei gelten viel weniger strenge regeln
zb bzgl konsistenz (vgl auch arrow). ob community denken gut ist, bleibt
offen, aber es passiert ja offenbar. evtl wäre der absatz über diesem
ein argument gegen solches community denken (will ich nicht FÜR
community denken plädieren?)

I have just talked about the consistency of beliefs of communities. But
we are here concerned with general ethical belief, which one would
assume to be independent from the practical belief of some community.
(bessere überleitung) This disparity is the subject of the second
objection to relativism: Ethics is nothing related to the welfare of any
community, but it is related to the welfare of all – ethics has a
universal domain.

-   i do \_not\_ want to say that ethics applies population-wise (as one
    could think from my examples above). it applies of course to the
    complete domain of humans, because all humans have similar interests
    (<span id="ref:RNDitrDlHBuIn"
    label="ref:RNDitrDlHBuIn">\[ref:RNDitrDlHBuIn\]</span>Stemmer 2000).

-   infer intuition of neutrality with a real range from egoistic
    interests

    -   it is unlikely that all or many people would grant rights to
        nonexisting

    -   there is no per se effect of happiness on other people’s
        happiness, but in the extremes it is highly likely

        -   mitleidsethik

        -   psychological problem: people do not evaluate the effect of
            mitleid as a change of their own welfare, but as a change of
            global welfare!

        -   -&gt; revisionism: when these effects are really properly
            included in the welfare function, then we can have an ion
            that they are completely irrelevant

Conclusion
==========

-   explain why objection 3 is most important: 1 and 2 rely on rawls and
    avg util, which are basically based on an analytic explanation of –
    within our linguistic framework – justice as fairness and ethics as
    impartiality, resp., whilst 3 is based on the interest of people and
    thus normative

In summary, Broome commits two errors: In two common frameworks his
“hard-to-doubt” strong Pareto assumption is false. In the third
framework his implicit assumption that the intuition of neutrality
requires proper ranges of neutral values is false. It is also plausible
that the assumptions on their own do not reflect common ethical
intuition. The intuition of neutrality might actually be right.

-   point out conclusion: ion can maybe be held in utilitarianism
    (revision: no range but uncertainty), for sure in rawls & similar
    frameworks, most plausibly in contractarianism (revision: no upper /
    lower boundaries)

-   sum up frameworks, discuss whether they are a complete partitioning
    of ethical belief

-   (Assuming that ethics is a system which should be built up from
    people’s ethical convictions,) we need empirical research on whether
    the intuition holds

-   impact on climate change? we need not care about unborn people and
    can make more straight calculations
