How should we as a society value changes in population size? I defend the intuition of neutrality, which answers a part of the question. It states that – other things being equal – it is ethically irrelevant whether or not additional people are added to a population. The argument against neutrality criticizes the intuition of neutrality as inconsistent.

The contribution of this thesis is twofold: First, the framework of welfare economics, the intuition of neutrality, and the argument against neutrality is presented with formal rigour. Second, the formalizations is used for a critical analysis of the argument against neutrality. Three ethical frameworks are assumed – the difference principle, average utilitarianism, and contractarianism –, and their relation to the explicit and hidden premises of the argument against neutrality is investigated.

The result is that all three frameworks are compatible with the intuition of neutrality (or slightly modified versions); so the argument against neutrality does not hold within them:

1. The difference principle in its Leximin formulation is in contradiction to the principle of fair aggregation, which is a premise for the argument against neutrality.

2. The argument against neutrality has the implicit premise that the neutral range within which persons can be added to a population is a proper range. Average utilitarianism suggests to slightly modify the intuition of neutrality so that it uses a neutral level rather than a proper neutral range. Because of the uncertainty involved, this is in practice somewhat similar to the original intuition of neutrality.

3. Assuming metaethical time-relativism (as is usually the case in contractarian theories), the intuition of neutrality can be modified by introducing a base scenario for comparisons. This modification is in line with the spirit of the original intuition of neutrality.

As a result, the intuition of neutrality can be assumed in these frameworks. Whether the intuition of neutrality should be adopted is left open in this thesis. Assuming that ethics is a system which should be built up from people’s ethical convictions (a controversial claim on its own), an investigation into the empirical prevalence of the intuition should be conducted. If the intuition of neutrality is considered correct, it might simplify calculations with regard to pressing problems such as global warming.
