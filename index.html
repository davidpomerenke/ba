<!--l. 4--><p class="noindent" >How should we as a society value changes in population size? The question
may be crucial when evaluating global warming scenarios. I defend the
intuition of neutrality, which answers a part of the question. It states that –
other things being equal – it is ethically irrelevant whether or not additional
people are added to a population. The argument against neutrality criticizes
the intuition of neutrality as inconsistent.
<!--l. 6--><p class="indent" >   The contribution of this thesis is twofold: First, the framework of welfare
economics, the intuition of neutrality, and the argument against neutrality are
presented with formal rigour. Second, the formalizations will be used for a
critical analysis of the argument against neutrality. Three ethical frameworks
will be assumed – the diﬀerence principle, average utilitarianism, and
contractarianism –, and their relation to the explicit and hidden premises of
the argument against neutrality will be investigated.
<!--l. 8--><p class="indent" >   The result will be that all three frameworks are compatible with the intuition
of neutrality (or slightly modiﬁed versions); so the argument against neutrality
does not hold within them.
<!--l. 10--><p class="indent" >   The analysis is built on several controversial philosophical views and does
not necessarily disprove the argument against neutrality. Rather, it undermines
the authority of the argument by pointing out the weakness of several
premises within the three frameworks.
<!--l. 12--><p class="indent" >   I begin by brieﬂy introducing the framework of welfare economics, which
this essay argues within. I then present in more detail the intuition of neutrality
and the formal argument brought forward against it. The main part is
                                                                  

                                                                  
dedicated to the development of three lines of argumentation in opposition
to the argument against neutrality (thus defending the intuition of
neutrality). I conclude with a systematic summary of the three lines of
argumentation.

<!--l. 4--><p class="noindent" >Welfare economics is the theory how individual well-being should be
aggregated to general well-being (or welfare). General well-being drives
decisions in the welfare state. The theory is relevant for the execution as well
as the design of economic policies. As in democracies the citizens and their
representatives take part in the design process, welfare economics is subject
to societal discourse in these nations. Within this discourse, citizens and media
often do not only claim their own interests. Instead they also refer to ethical
principles which are to guide democratic policy decisions. This essay is set
within this democratic discourse and aims to defend a supposedly
widespread intuition whose consistency has been challenged from the
academic side.
<!--l. 6--><p class="indent" >   The core of welfare economics is the welfare function (see <span class="cite"><a 
href="#Xharsanyi_1955">Harsanyi</a></a>,
1955</a>, p. 309</span>). It is an aggregation function: a function which takes in
the individual levels of well-being of several individual persons, and
delivers the level of welfare for the whole aggregated population
comprising these individual persons. Well-being and welfare (which refers to
aggregated well-being) are abstract terms. They are usually interpreted as a
representation derived from a person’s preferences about diﬀerent lives
(cf. <span class="cite"><a 
href="#Xcrisp_2017">Crisp</a></a>, 2017</a>, ch. 4.2</span>). But they can also be interpreted simply as
hedonic levels of lifetime pleasure <span class="cite">(<a 
href="#Xcrisp_2017">Crisp</a></a>, 2017</a>, ch. 4.1)</span>, which will
be suﬃcient for the purpose of this thesis. Well-being (or utility) of a
person p is denoted by <span 
class="cmssi-10">u</span><span 
class="cmss-10">(</span><span 
class="cmssi-10">p</span><span 
class="cmss-10">)</span>; individual persons are denoted by <span 
class="cmssi-10">p</span><sub><span

<!--l. 16--><p class="indent" >   The content of the general welfare function is intentionally unspeciﬁed.
The function is just a vehicle for discussion within welfare economics. Several
speciﬁc welfare functions have been proposed and we will deal with two of
them in later sections. For example, the classical utilitarian welfare function
states that welfare is simply the sum <tspan font-family="cmssi" font-size="10">u</tspan><tspan font-family="cmss" font-size="10">(</tspan><tspan font-family="cmssi" font-size="10">p</tspan><sub><tspan font-family="cmss" font-size="8">1</tspan></sub><tspan font-family="cmss" font-size="10">) + </tspan><tspan font-family="cmssi" font-size="10">u</tspan><tspan font-family="cmss" font-size="10">(</tspan><tspan font-family="cmssi" font-size="10">p</tspan><sub><tspan font-family="cmss" font-size="8">2</tspan></sub><tspan font-family="cmss" font-size="10">) +</tspan> <tspan font-family="cmssi" font-size="10">… </tspan><tspan font-family="cmss" font-size="10">+ </tspan><tspan font-family="cmssi" font-size="10">u</tspan><tspan font-family="cmss" font-size="10">(</tspan><tspan font-family="cmssi" font-size="10">p</tspan><sub><tspan font-family="cmssi" font-size="8">n</tspan></sub><tspan font-family="cmss" font-size="10">) </tspan>of all individual
well-being.
<!--l. 18--><p class="indent" >   I introduce welfare functions because they are precise formalizations of
competing ethical beliefs. In sections <a 
href="#x1-80002.1">2.1<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:obj1 --></a> and <a 
href="#x1-90002.2">2.2<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:obj2 --></a>, I will make use of them in
order to demonstrate that when we assume certain ethical intuitions, the
argument against neutrality does not hold. I will present two widespread
competing ethical belief systems – average utilitarianism, and the diﬀerence
principle – and try to refute the argument against neutrality from each of
these views. The idea is that many people will adhere to one of these
principles so that they can agree with at least one of the refutations. (Section
<a 
href="#x1-100002.3">2.3<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:obj3 --></a> is of a diﬀerent kind because, rather than to speciﬁc welfare functions, it
relates to their justiﬁcation.)
<!--l. 20--><p class="indent" >   It should be brieﬂy noted that welfare economics are blind – and so will be
this discussion – in that they are consequentialist. This means that they only
evaluate actions by their outcome and in this context speciﬁcally by their
impact on general welfare or goodness. Other elements of ethical
evaluation, such as the procedural requirements of justice, will have to be
considered separately (cf. <span class="cite"><a 
href="#Xbroome_2005">Broome</a></a>, 2005</a>, p. 401</span>; <span class="cite"><a 
href="#Xbroome_2012">Broome</a></a>, 2012</a>, p. 99f</span>). These
separate considerations will often require consequentialist considerations as
part of their theoretical foundation, so this discussion may be indirectly
relevant for them.
                                                                  

                                                                  
   <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">1.2    </span> <a 
 id="x1-50001.2"></a>The intuition of neutrality</h3>
<!--l. 3--><p class="noindent" >The <tspan font-family="pagko7t" font-size="">intuition of neutrality </tspan>is assumed to be a widespread ethical intuition
among humans <span class="cite">(<a 
href="#Xbroome_2012">Broome</a></a>, 2012</a>, p. 176f)</span>. The content of the intuition is called
the principle of equal existence <span class="cite">(<a 
href="#Xbroome_2004">Broome</a></a>, 2004</a>, p. 146)</span>, but usually (and also
in this thesis) the term ’intuition’ is used to refer both to the empirical
intuition of neutrality and to the propositional content of the intuition of
neutrality.
<!--l. 5--><p class="indent" >   The content of the intuition is deﬁned as follows: Let us assume two
hypothetical scenarios A and B. The same people exist in both scenarios,
except that in scenario B there are some additional people which do not
exist in scenario A. The intuition says: Which one of the scenarios is better
depends entirely on the well-being of the people who exist in both
scenarios, and not at all on the additional people who only exist in B –
as long as all the additional people in B have a well-being within a
certain neutral range. More speciﬁcally, as long as the additional
people in B are within the neutral range, scenario A is better in terms of
welfare if the people who exist in both populations have a higher
welfare in scenario A, and scenario B is better in terms of welfare if the
people who exist in both populations have a higher welfare in scenario
B.
<!--l. 7--><p class="indent" >   We can formalize the scenarios as diﬀerent welfare distributions
represented by the welfare functions <tspan font-family="cmssi" font-size="10">u</tspan><sub><tspan font-family="cmssi" font-size="8">A</tspan></sub> and <tspan font-family="cmssi" font-size="10">u</tspan><sub><tspan font-family="cmssi" font-size="8">B</tspan></sub> (read: <tspan font-family="cmssi" font-size="10">u </tspan><tspan font-family="pagko7t" font-size="">under the</tspan>

Let <tspan font-family="cmssi" font-size="10">P</tspan><sub><tspan font-family="cmss" font-size="8">0</tspan></sub> be a population of people who exist in both scenarios but need not
have the same levels of well-being in both scenarios. Let <tspan font-family="cmssi" font-size="10">P</tspan><sub><tspan font-family="cmss" font-size="8">+</tspan></sub> be the
population of people who exist only in scenario B. Let <tspan font-family="cmss" font-size="10">[</tspan><tspan font-family="cmssi" font-size="10">u</tspan><sub><tspan font-family="cmss" font-size="8">1</tspan></sub><tspan font-family="cmss" font-size="10">,</tspan><tspan font-family="cmssi" font-size="10">u</tspan><sub><tspan font-family="cmss" font-size="8">2</tspan></sub><tspan font-family="cmss" font-size="10">] </tspan>be the neutral
range of well-being for added people.

<!--l. 33--><p class="indent" >   The formalization is to be interpreted in the following way: It does not
matter in terms of welfare whether there exists an additional person in the
population who lives at a moderate level of well-being. There are
several moderate levels of well-beings, which form a range between a
low moderate level of well-being <tspan font-family="cmssi" font-size="10">u</tspan><sub><tspan font-family="cmss" font-size="8">1</tspan></sub> and a high moderate level of
well-being <tspan font-family="cmssi" font-size="10">u</tspan><sub><tspan font-family="cmss" font-size="8">2</tspan></sub>. If however the additional person is at a very low level of
well-being – below <tspan font-family="cmssi" font-size="10">u</tspan><sub><tspan font-family="cmss" font-size="8">1</tspan></sub> – then the person might matter for the calculation of
general well-being. (Arguably, the welfare would decrease because
of the added person; though this is not speciﬁed by the intuition.)
Similarly, if the additional person is at a very high level of well-being –
above <tspan font-family="cmssi" font-size="10">u</tspan><sub><tspan font-family="cmss" font-size="8">2</tspan></sub> – then the person might matter for the calculation of general
well-being. (Arguably, the welfare would increase because of the added
person.)
<!--l. 35--><p class="indent" >   There is a speciﬁcation of the intuition of neutrality where the neutral range
has no upper limit, i. e., <tspan font-family="cmssi" font-size="10">u</tspan><sub><tspan font-family="cmss" font-size="8">2</tspan></sub> <tspan font-family="cmss" font-size="10">= </tspan><tspan font-family="cmsy" font-size="10">∞</tspan><span class="cite">(<a 
href="#Xbroome_2012">Broome</a></a>, 2012</a>, p. 113)</span>. This may be an
accurate of common belief. Whether the upper limit of the range is ﬁnite or
inﬁnite is of minor concern for this thesis; it is more important to note that there
is <tspan font-family="pagko7t" font-size="">some </tspan>neutral range.
<!--l. 37--><p class="indent" >   If the range is suﬃciently large, this might simplify welfare calculations, as
the following examples demonstrate:
<ul class="itemize1">
                                                                  

                                                                  
<li class="itemize">An exemplary application of the intuition is the evaluation of road safety
<span class="cite">(<a 
href="#Xbroome_2004">Broome</a></a>, </a>, p. 144f)</span>. In this context, the deaths of people dying in accidents
must be weighed against the costs of preventing them. Whilst this is
an ethically diﬃcult problem on its own, one important long-term
eﬀect is usually left aside: The well-being of the expected potential
oﬀspring of the potentially dying person is completely neglected.
One possible justiﬁcation is the intuition of neutrality: According to the
intuition, if we can expect the oﬀspring to live within the neutral range
of well-being, it is neither positive nor negative whether they exist or
not.
   </li>
<li class="itemize">A second example is the evaluation of diﬀerent scenarios of global warming
<span class="cite">(<a 
href="#Xbroome_2012">Broome</a></a>, 2012</a>, p. 170)</span>. Global warming is likely to kill many people and
thereby to prevent their oﬀspring from existing. On the other hand, global
warming may increase poverty, which is associated with higher birth rates.
Thanks to the intuition of neutrality we can simply leave both of these eﬀects
aside in many of our evaluations – which comes handy as predictions in these
domains attend to an enormous amount of uncertainty. <span class="cite"><a 
href="#Xbroome_2012">Broome</a></a>, 2012</a>,
p. 120ﬀ.</span> sees massive problems if the intuition of neutrality cannot be
assumed to apply.</li></ul>
<!--l. 44--><p class="indent" >   It is important to understand that the intuition of neutrality does not imply
neutrality about the consequences on the existing population which are
caused by the additional population. These consequences may be negative
or positive, leading to contrary political reactions such as China’s restrictive
one-child-policy and Europe’s reproduction-promoting policy <span class="cite">(<a 
href="#Xbroome_2012">Broome</a></a>, 2012</a>,
p. 169)</span>. The consequences on the existing population may well determine
whether additional people are good or not. Only the well-being of the
additional people themselves does not do so according to the intuition of
neutrality.
<!--l. 46--><p class="indent" >   The question whether the intuition of neutrality is in fact a widespread
                                                                  

                                                                  
intuition among humans appears not to have been investigated. It is not
necessary for the argument against neutrality to assume such an empirical
fact. Neither is it necessary for the refutation of this argument to assume so. If
however this refutation were successful and the integrity of the intuition thus
restored, then it would be desirable to investigate the empirical prevalence
of the intuition.

additional person has a level of well-being within the neutral range. The
argument is structured into two major steps:
<!--l. 50--><p class="indent" >   First, scenario A is being compared to scenario B and to scenario C. The
additional person can be neglected in this step because the person is within

well-being, it is reasonable that there is a higher welfare in scenario B
than in scenario A. Contrarily, there is one person who is a little bit
worse oﬀ in scenario C than in scenario A. As all other persons have
exactly the same level of well-being, it is reasonable that there is a
higher welfare in scenario A than in scenario C. As a consequence of
these two observations, scenario B has a higher welfare than scenario
C. Technically, this conclusion requires transitivity of the betterness
relation.

comprise the same people, so there is no additional person in either scenario
who could be neglected. The person who is not present in scenario A and
has therefore been neglected above is much better oﬀ in scenario C
than in scenario B. This big diﬀerence clearly outweighs the diﬀerence
of the other person’s well-being in favour of scenario B. As there is
moreover a lower inequality in scenario C, scenario C has a higher welfare

First, if in two scenarios all persons have the same level of well-being except

the second scenario is higher than in the ﬁrst. Technically, we can say that the
second scenario Pareto dominates the ﬁrst <span class="cite">(<a

<!--l. 5--><p class="noindent" >I will start by delivering some general criticism on Pareto domination and
aggregation and then continue to examine their relation to justice-oriented
welfare functions, speciﬁcally the Maximin and Leximin rule.
<!--l. 7--><p class="indent" >   When we say that a scenario Pareto dominates another scenario, we
mean that at least one person is better oﬀ in this scenario than in the other
while all other persons are at an equal level of well-being. The Pareto
principle I have formulated as (P2) says that in such cases the ﬁrst scenario
has a higher welfare than the other one. This principle, as well as the
extending requirement of Pareto eﬃciency (cf. <span class="cite"><a 
href="#Xosborne_1997">Osborne</a></a>, 1997</a></span>), ﬁnd their due
place in economics where the objective is the eﬃcient allocation of scarce
resources (<span class="cite"><a 
href="#Xsamuelson_2010">Samuelson &amp; Nordhaus</a></a>, 2010</a>, p. 4</span>; <span class="cite"><a 
href="#Xlange_2019">Lange</a></a>, 2019</a></span>). However I doubt
that they are suitable as ethical principles. Pareto eﬃciency has been
criticized because the liberal paradox suggests that it may be incompatible
with procedural elements of liberalism (see <span class="cite"><a 
href="#Xsen_1997">Sen &amp; Foster</a></a>, 1997</a></span>). But I
believe that there is a more general problem with Pareto eﬃciency
and even with Pareto domination: Consider a large population with
one person whose well-being is much higher than the well-being of
the others. Is it ethically desirable – is there a higher welfare – if the
welll-being of this person is increased even more, while the well-being of
the other persons remains the same? This can be intuitively doubted,
and below I show some mildly convincing reasoning in favour of this
doubt.
<!--l. 9--><p class="indent" >   A similar criticism applies to what I have called the fair aggregation
principle. The fair aggregation principle is a combination of what can be
called the simple aggregation principle – that general welfare is the simple
sum of all individual well-being – with the additional requirement that
distributions need be more equal to have a higher welfare. The principle is
                                                                  

                                                                  
non-exhaustive: it does not tell us anything about populations with a
higher sum of well-being and a lower equality, and it does not tell us
anything about populations with a lower sum of well-being and a
higher equality. But that is not a problem, since such populations do
not play a relevant role in the counter-example to the intuition of
neutrality.
<!--l. 11--><p class="indent" >   The problem with the requirement of equality is that, analytically, equality
is a global criterion, which means that it somehow takes into account the
well-being of every single person. This implies that a small decrease <tspan font-family="cmmi" font-size="10">𝜖</tspan>
in well-being of the person who already is worst oﬀ can always be
compensated by some large increase of equality within the rest of
the population. This follows because otherwise the well-being of the
worst-oﬀ person would completely determine the equality – which is
intuitively plausible, but not incorporated in the conception of inequality
measures.
<!--l. 13--><p class="indent" >   Now imagine three scenarios, all with the same people: In scenario X
there is some utility distribution with lots of inequality. The person who is worst
oﬀ in scenario X is called p. In scenario Y, the well-being of the worst-oﬀ
person from scenario X is decreased by some very small amount <tspan font-family="cmmi" font-size="10">𝜖</tspan>. Due to the
globality of inequality, this can be compensated in terms of equality
by improving the equality within all the other persons to a more or
less drastical amount. Let us assume that such compensation has
taken place, so that the overall equality in scenario Y is higher than in
scenario X. With the usual inequality functions this will be possible without
decreasing the sum of well-being (cf. <span class="cite"><a 
href="#Xceriani_2012">Ceriani &amp; Verme</a></a>, 2012</a></span>). Let us
further assume that in a third scenario Z all people are at the same
level of well-being as the people in scenario Y, plus <img 
src="thesis1x.png" alt="𝜖
2"  class="frac" align="middle">. The general
equality has not decreased in Z in comparison to Y. (Depending on
the inequality function, it may even have increased, because the
relative diﬀerences between the least well-oﬀ and the most well-oﬀ
have decreased.) However the sum of well-being is increased in Z in
                                                                  

                                                                  
comparison to X because the well-being of many persons has been
increased by <img 
src="thesis2x.png" alt="𝜖
2"  class="frac" align="middle"> while the well-being of only one person has been
decreased by <img 
src="thesis3x.png" alt="𝜖
2"  class="frac" align="middle">. As a consequence, both the sum of individual well-being
and the equality are better in Z than in X, so according to the fair
aggregation principle there is a higher welfare in Z than in X. At the
same time, the worst-oﬀ person in X is even worse oﬀ in Z. This seems
intuitively implausible and I will now present a theory which explains this
implausibility.
<!--l. 15--><p class="indent" >   For this objection I will use as a speciﬁc welfare function the diﬀerence
principle. The diﬀerence principle is a concept which is inferred from an
analysis of justice. Its justiﬁcation as the second principle of justice is given
and extensively discussed in <span class="cite">(<a 
href="#Xrawls_2005">Rawls</a></a>, 2005</a>, pp. 3-183)</span>. Rivalling average
utilitarianism, the diﬀerence principle is probably the most prominent
and most widely accepted welfare function. In its core formula, the
diﬀerence principle states that diﬀerences from socioeconomic equality
are only permitted if they are to the beneﬁt of the least advantaged
<span class="cite">(<a 
href="#Xrawls_2005">Rawls</a></a>, 2005</a>, p. 302)</span>. This implies that society should aim to optimize the
status of the least advantaged. The diﬀerence principle is therefore
usually represented as a welfare function where general welfare is
determined only by the well-being of the group with the lowest level of
well-being. (Such representation commits a major error in ignoring
the diﬀerence between primary goods and well-being as I discuss in
<span class="cite"><a 
href="#Xpomerenke_2017">Pomerenke</a></a>, 2017</a>, p. 12f</span>. – But this does not bear upon the reasoning here,
which is based solely on Pareto comparisons.) Whilst the diﬀerence
principle refers to the least advantaged group – which makes sense in
application – there is no mistake in referring to the least advantaged
person for the sake of theory (cf. <span class="cite">(<a 
href="#Xrawls_2005">Rawls</a></a>, 2005</a>, p. 98)</span>). Because of its
resemblance to the decision-theoretic rule of minimum maximization, this
formulation of the principle has also been called the Maximin rule.
(Although this labelling has been rightly criticized in <span class="cite"><a 
href="#Xrawls_2001">Rawls &amp; Kelly</a></a>, 2001</a>,
p. 43.</span>.)

<!--l. 21--><p class="indent" >   According to the diﬀerence principle in its Maximin version, both Pareto
domination and fair aggregation are false: Imagine that one person who is
not the worst-oﬀ in either scenario is better oﬀ in the ﬁrst scenario than in
the second while all other persons are equally well oﬀ. Then Pareto
domination requires that the ﬁrst scenario has a higher welfare. The
Maximin rule, however, states that both scenarios have the same welfare
because the well-being of the worst-oﬀ person has not changed. And
we have seen above that as a consequence of fair aggregation a
scenario may be evaluated as having a higher welfare even if the
worst-oﬀ person is even worse oﬀ – in strict contradiction to the diﬀerence
principle.
<!--l. 23--><p class="indent" >   But the diﬀerence principle in its Maximin formulation has been designed
as a simpliﬁcation with the practical idea in mind that there will seldom
or never be a comparison in which the least advantaged will have
the exactly same level of well-being in both scenarios. Yet for the
theoretical case of a such comparison a more elaborate rule than
the Maximin rule has been developed (cf. <span class="cite"><a 
href="#Xrawls_2005">Rawls</a></a>, 2005</a>, p. 83</span>): It says
that in the case that the least advantaged are at the same level in
both scenarios, the second-least advantaged must be regarded.
And if the second-least advantaged are also at the same level, then
the third-least advantaged must be regarded, and so on. Because it
resembles a lexicographical sorting algorithm, the extended rule is
called the Leximin rule. It is most clearly formulated as a recursive
selection function which outputs the better population of two populations
whose members are sorted in ascending order according to their
                                                                  

                                                                  
well-being:

<!--l. 43--><p class="indent" >   We can easily observe that – unlike the Maximin rule – the Leximin
rule is compatible with Pareto domination: If all persons are equal in
two scenarios except one who is better oﬀ in the second scenario,
then the Leximin algorithm will recursively call another instance of the
Leximin algorithm (where the worst-oﬀ from the outer instance will be
                                                                  

                                                                  
disregarded), until an instance is called where the two persons in questions
are the worst-oﬀ persons in their respective scenarios. This process
automatically ensures Pareto domination. So at a second glance
at the diﬀerence principle, it does not contradict but indeed rather
support Pareto domination. This is in favour of the argument against
neutrality.
<!--l. 45--><p class="indent" >   The same, however, cannot be said about the relation of the diﬀerence
principle to the principle of fair aggregation. We have seen above
that fair aggregation in some cases evaluates distributions as being
better than a second distribution even though the worst-oﬀ person
is better oﬀ in the second distribution. In such a case, the Leximin
algorithm would stop in the ﬁrst iteration, with a result equivalent to
the result of the Maximin rule. The algorithm would not regard the
improved well-being of all the other persons, because not only the
Maximin rule but also the Leximin rule deem all general improvements
irrelevant if they are to the disadvantage of the least advantaged. So
for one major welfare function the ”hard-to-doubt” premise of fair
aggregation (P4) is false and the argument against neutrality cannot
succeed.
<!--l. 47--><p class="indent" >   At the beginning of this section, two intuitive objections to the Pareto
principle and the fair aggregation principle have been raised. The objection
to the Pareto principle appeared to be supported by assuming the
diﬀerence principle as a welfare function; however it turned out that the
diﬀerence principle is only contradictory to the Pareto principle in its Maximin
formulation, not in the more general and theoretically preferable
formulation as the Leximin rule. The objection to the fair aggregation
principle, however, was supported by both the Maximin and the Leximin
formulation of the diﬀerence principle. As the fair aggregation principle is a
necessary premise for the argument against neutrality, the argument
therefore fails when the diﬀerence principle is assumed as a welfare

diﬀerence in well-being between scenarios B and C for person q must
be negative. So the neutral range must allow for such a diﬀerence,

substantive speciﬁcation of the intuition of neutrality. Contentwise (C12) is
completely in line with the idea behind the intuition of neutrality (cf. <span class="cite"><a

neutrality has a hidden premise, which has not been made explicit so far:

speciﬁcally but not only when it is understood as a complete moral theory
rather than only a theory of goodness (cf. <span class="cite"><a

popular and consistent ethical theory which is not only able to account for
many other ethical intuitions but also to answer our quantitative and
justiﬁcatory questions regarding the neutral level of well-being. The welfare
function of average utilitarianism states that general welfare is the average of
all individual well-being:

<!--l. 49--><p class="indent" >   This implies that in order to be neutral to existing welfare, the welfare of an
added population must equal the welfare of the existing population. Not
every single added person needs to be at this neutral level, but rather the
average of all added persons needs to be at this level.

<!--l. 55--><p class="indent" >   So average utilitarianism provides a response to the argument against
neutrality by modifying the intuition of neutrality and assuming a neutral level
instead of a neutral range. As a result, the intuition is consistent, calculable,
and maybe even justiﬁed (regarding the justiﬁcation, cf. <span class="cite"><a 
href="#Xrawls_2005">Rawls</a></a>, 2005</a>,
pp. 161-175</span>; and also <span class="cite"><a 
href="#Xarrhenius_2017">Arrhenius et al.</a></a>, 2017</a></span>). Average utilitarianism plays (in
this case) a revisionist role, a theory of moral error (cf. <span class="cite"><a 
href="#Xmackie_1990">Mackie</a></a>, 1990</a>,
p. 35</span>): It tells us to slightly adjust our intuition – to sharpen it – so that it is
consistent in itself and in its relation to other moral judgments. This is an
acceptable, maybe desirable intervention to the beliefs from our
intuition.
<!--l. 57--><p class="indent" >   Furthermore, this theoretical sharpening would not even necessarily
                                                                  

                                                                  
change our application of the intuition of neutrality. This is because in
practice, uncertainties are attached to all quantities of well-being,
speciﬁcally the neutral value. When I talk of ’uncertainty’ here, then I refer to
’measurement uncertainty’ as used in statistics and the quantitative
sciences. (The uncertainty in question is quantiﬁable, so in it falls into the
decision-theoretic category of risk and not into the decision-theoretic
category of uncertainty.) Measurement uncertainty is a well-developed
theory (see, e. g., <span class="cite"><a 
href="#Xrunge_2007">Runge</a></a>, 2007</a></span>). Unlike the approaches of introducing
indeterminacy in the forms of incommensurateness or vagueness (cf.
alternative (d) in section <a 
href="#x1-60001.3">1.3<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:arg --></a>) – which are pursued and discarded as a solution
to the argument against neutrality in <span class="cite"><a 
href="#Xbroome_2004">Broome</a></a>, 2004</a>, pp. 164-183</span> – uncertainty
does not suﬀer from diﬃcult problems such as greediness (a problem
discussed in <span class="cite"><a

<!--l. 74--><p class="indent" >   This section has explained that there is at least no obvious possibility of
justifying such a range, and that as a consequence we do not know how to
quantify the range. Average utilitarianism presents a possible justiﬁcation for a
neutral level, and together with uncertainty it can justify something like a
range. This formal interpretation may be even closer to the empirical intuition
of neutrality than the interpretation as a real range is. If it is not, the problem
of the incomparability within the neutral range and the problem of the
quantiﬁability of the neutral range present compelling reasons why we should
adjust our intuitions.

neutrality does not hold for diﬀerent reasons. Yet, although these frameworks
are so well received, they both raise the question of how they should be
justiﬁed. The speciﬁc justiﬁcatory problem which matters in our context is that
the frameworks assume a universal moral domain. This means that
they assume that in the ﬁrst place every person should receive moral
consideration. If the universal domain is rejected, the results of sections <a

neutrality fails if the universal domain is rejected, and afterwards we will
discuss whether such a relativistic position is acceptable. In the context of this
section, ’relativism’ refers to the procedure of undertaking ethical
evaluations with respect to a certain (temporally limited) population
rather than with respect to all persons ever existing. In a relativistic
interpretation, ’goodness’ is to be understood as ’goodness for someone or
some group’, and in our context usually as ’goodness for the current
(world) population’. This form of relativism is more precisely referred to as

<!--l. 8--><p class="indent" >   So far we have interpreted the intuition of neutrality as a principle which is

current population. <tspan font-family="cmssi" font-size="10">P</tspan><sub><tspan font-family="cmss" font-size="8">0</tspan></sub> will thus be the current world population, and <tspan font-family="cmssi" font-size="10">P</tspan><sub><tspan font-family="cmss" font-size="8">+</tspan></sub> will

<!--l. 78--><p class="noindent" >I will now address both issues.
<!--l. 80--><p class="indent" >   The problem of incoherence cannot be denied: If ethical evaluations of
welfare depend on the choice of the base scenario and if every person
chooses the person’s own (current) situation as the base scenario,
incoherence will arise. Principally, there are relativistic inconsistencies of
several kinds. E. g., one person could contradict another person from the
same population. As we are concerned with population ethics here, where
persons will usually somehow consider the whole population for their
evaluation, this is not necessarily a problem. A necessary problem is the
time-dependence of the evaluation, which is pointed out in <span class="cite"><a 
href="#Xbroome_2004">Broome</a></a>, 2004</a>,
p. 75</span>:
     <div class="quote">
     <!--l. 82--><p class="noindent" >”You choose rightly, but it later turns out you chose wrongly.
     Indeed, it may turn out that you ought later to undo what you
     rightly did. Moreover, you might be able to foresee even as
     you choose [your action] that just this would happen. This is a
     most implausible sort of incoherence in your activity.”</div>
<!--l. 85--><p class="indent" >   This criticism of time-relativity sounds like a problem at ﬁrst, but I will now try
to plausibilize that it might be acceptable.
<!--l. 87--><p class="indent" >   One possible defence of time-relativity is in denying that incoherence
between actions is a problem at all. Incoherent actions are sometimes
criticized in everyday situations; for example, when two persons or one
person act out two actions which appear to follow opposite intentions, we
might say that the actions are incoherent (or inconsistent). But the
                                                                  

                                                                  
conceptual basis for such ascriptions is rather fuzzy and the existing
theory of rationality does not provide a criterion for directly identifying
incoherent actions. What the theory of rationality does provide is a
criterion for identifying incoherent beliefs: Beliefs are incoherent if their
propositional contents are contradictory. The only philosophically developed
theory for criticizing inconsistent actions is (to my knowledge) to criticize
inconsistencies in the belief set motivating the action (cf. <span class="cite"><a 
href="#Xwilson_2016">Wilson &amp; Shpall</a></a>,
2016</a>, ch. 4</span>).
<!--l. 89--><p class="indent" >   The underlying beliefs in a situation of alleged incoherence due to
time-relativistic reasoning are complex: Before action A, we think that we
should do A. And we think that as a causal eﬀect of doing A, we will regret
having done A. So we think that we should do A, and that we will regret it
afterwards. After the action A, we think that we should not have done A. We
also think that we have thought that we should do A. The point is that there is
no apparent formal contradiction within this belief set. – It may very
well be rational to think A at the moment and to expect that oneself
would think the opposite of A under diﬀerent circumstances. As the
enactment of A causes a change of circumstances, the complex
belief set above may come about, and there is nothing wrong with
it.
<!--l. 91--><p class="indent" >   Similarly, one may deny that it is irrational to <tspan font-family="pagko7t" font-size="">undo </tspan>an action (cf. <span class="cite"><a 
href="#Xbroome_2004">Broome</a></a>,
2004</a>, p. 75</span>). A is done within one set of circumstances and then within
another set of circumstances it is undone. The two actions of ’doing A’ and
’undoing A’ can be diﬀerentiated by the fact that they have taken place
within diﬀerent contexts (one context without the causal eﬀects of A
and one context with the causal eﬀects of A). There is no obvious
reason to ignore the contexts of the actions and to strip them down to
the notions of ’doing A’ and ’undoing A’, creating a possibly false
dichotomy.
<!--l. 93--><p class="indent" >   The above argumentation – that the apparent incoherence due to
temporal relativity is not irrational – will certainly be highly controversial. But it
                                                                  

                                                                  
is much more plausible that it applies to group beliefs and group actions. And
it is group actions towards which the criticism of population-relativity in
<span class="cite"><a 
href="#Xbroome_2004">Broome</a></a>, 2004</a>, pp. 157-162</span> is directed.
<!--l. 97--><p class="noindent" ><object data="thesis-39.svg" width="460.99825 " height="450.76416 " type="image/svg+xml"><p>SVG-Viewer needed.</p></object>
<!--l. 99--><p class="indent" >   One might object to the above example: ”If Alphaland was a single
person, we would criticize the annexation as irrational.” But this objection is
beyond the point: Groups, though they may be identiﬁed – analogous to
single persons – by names, do not possess beliefs in the same sense that
persons do. This becomes apparent in situations like voting, where, for
example, the voting paradox leads to counterintuitive conclusions (cf. <span class="cite"><a 
href="#Xlist_2013">List</a></a>,
                                                                  

                                                                  
2013</a>, ch. 1.1</span>). And group actions also belie one’s expectations with respect
to temporal coherence. Even if the rationality constraints of temporal
coherence may apply for individual persons (which I have questioned
above), they do not for groups.
<!--l. 101--><p class="indent" >   The previous paragraphs have been about the coherence of group
beliefs. One might object: Are we not concerned with general ethical belief,
which one would assume to be independent from the practical belief of
some community? The answer is that in metaethical relativism all ethical
evaluations depend on the fact which scenario is the base scenario,
and the choice of the base scenario depends on the own, current
population.
<!--l. 103--><p class="indent" >   After I have defended the form of metaethical relativism which comes

dropped in <span class="cite"><a 
href="#Xbroome_2004">Broome</a></a>, 2004</a>, p. 160f</span>, mainly because of (1) the alleged
incoherence discussed above and (2) the lack of justiﬁcation for the required
form of metaethical relativism. Regarding (2), there are indeed good reasons
why metaethical relativism is preferable to other preferable positions. I point
towards the <tspan font-family="pagko7t" font-size="">argument from queerness </tspan>and the <tspan font-family="pagko7t" font-size="">argument from relativity</tspan>
found in <span class="cite"><a

href="#Xjoyce_2016">Joyce</a></a>, 2016</a>, supp. 2</span>.
The contractarian tradition within ethics is closely associated with
metaethical relativism (including time-relativism). One sophisticated
contemporary ethical framework based on metaethical relativism is
presented in <span class="cite"><a 
href="#Xstemmer_2013">Stemmer</a></a>, 2013</a></span>. These references shall suﬃce to make clear
that the justiﬁcatory status of metaethical relativism needs not be
considered problematic, but to the contrary can be seen as very
satisfactory.
<!--l. 105--><p class="indent" >   Even more than the arguments in sections <a

href="#x1-90002.2">2.2<!--tex4ht:ref: sec:obj2 --></a>, the argumentation
in this section touches upon several philosophical controversies, notably
whether metaethical time-relativism is coherent and whether it is justiﬁed. The
result is that if both questions can be answered with yes, the argument
                                                                  

                                                                  
against neutrality is undermined. This is because metaethical time-relativism
allows us to modify the intuition of neutrality in a way that is consistent with its
original intention and which avoids the argument against neutrality by relying
on a base scenario.

<!--l. 4--><p class="noindent" >This thesis has formally presented the framework of welfare economics, the
intuition of neutrality, and the argument against (the intuition of) neutrality. It
has proceded by critically analyzing the impact of three (meta)ethical
frameworks on the soundness of the argument against neutrality, with the
following results:
     <dl class="enumerate-enumitem"><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">
  1. </dt><dd 
class="enumerate-enumitem">The diﬀerence principle in its Leximin formulation is in contradiction
     to   the   principle   of   fair   aggregation,   which   is   a   premise   for
     the  argument  against  neutrality.  The  argument  against  neutrality
     therefore does not hold when assuming the diﬀerence principle.
     </dd><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">
  2. </dt><dd 
class="enumerate-enumitem">The argument against neutrality has the implicit premise that the
     neutral range within which persons can be added to a population
     is a proper range. Average utilitarianism suggests to slightly modify
     the intuition of neutrality so that it uses a neutral level rather than
     a proper neutral range. Because of the uncertainty involved, this
     is in practice somewhat similar to the original intuition of neutrality.
     The  argument  against  neutrality  therefore  does  not  hold  when
     assuming average utilitarianism and slightly adjusting the intuition
     of neutrality accordingly.
     </dd><dt class="enumerate-enumitem">

     by introducing a base scenario for comparisons. This modiﬁcation
     is  in  line  with  the  spirit  of  the  original  intuition  of  neutrality.  The
     argument  against  neutrality  does  not  hold  when  assuming  this
     modiﬁcation.</dd></dl>
<!--l. 11--><p class="indent" >   This means that in any of the three frameworks – diﬀerence principle,
average utilitarianism, implementations of metaethical relativism such as
moral contractarianism – the argument against neutrality does not hold.
