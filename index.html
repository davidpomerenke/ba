<!--l. 3--><p class="noindent" >How should we as a society value changes in population size? The question
may be crucial when evaluating global warming scenarios. I defend the
intuition of neutrality, which answers a part of the question. It states that –
other things being equal – it is ethically irrelevant whether or not additional
people are added to a population. The argument against neutrality criticizes
the intuition to be inconsistent. I present three new objections to the
argument: First, economic eﬃciency needs not be assumed as an ethical
principle. Second, the intuition can be interpreted consistently in terms
of uncertainty. Third, the intuition can be interpreted and justiﬁed in
contractarianism. These objections are independent from each other. They
are built on controversial philosophical views and do not necessarily
disprove the argument against neutrality. Rather, they undermine the
authority of the argument by pointing out the weakness of several
premises.
<!--l. 5--><p class="indent" >   I begin by brieﬂy introducing the framework of welfare economics, which
this essay argues within. I then present in more detail the intuition of neutrality
and the formal argument brought forward against it. The main part is
dedicated to the development of three objections to the argument. I
conclude with some remarks about the status and plausibility of the diﬀerent
objections.

<!--l. 4--><p class="noindent" >Welfare economics is the theory how individual well-being should be
aggregated to general well-being (or welfare). General well-being drives
decisions in the welfare state. The theory is relevant for the execution as well
as the design of economic policies. As in democracies the citizens and their
representatives take part in the design process, welfare economics is subject
to societal discourse in these nations. Within this discourse, citizens and media
often do not only claim their own interests. Instead they also refer to ethical
principles which are to guide democratic policy decisions. This essay is set
within this democratic discourse and aims to defend a supposedly
widespread intuition whose consistency has been challenged from the
academic side.
<!--l. 6--><p class="indent" >   The core of welfare economics is the welfare function (see Harsanyi
1955, p. 309). It is an aggregation function: a function which takes in
the individual levels of well-being of several individual persons,  and
delivers the level of welfare for the whole aggregated population
comprising these individual persons. Well-being and welfare (which refers to
aggregated well-being) are abstract terms. They are usually interpreted as a
representation of preferences over diﬀerent lives. But they can also be
interpreted simply as hedonistic levels of lifetime pleasure, which will
be suﬃcient for the purpose of this essay. Well-being (or utility) of a
person p is denoted by u(p); individual persons are denoted by pi – the
subscript is just there to diﬀerentiate between diﬀerent persons. In similar
fashion, welfare of a population P = <span 
class="cmsy-10">{ </span>p1, p2, …, pn <span 
class="cmsy-10">} </span>is denoted by
u(P).
<!--l. 8--><p class="indent" >     Deﬁnition 1: Welfare function
<!--l. 13--><p class="indent" >   The content of the general welfare function is intentionally unspeciﬁed.
                                                                  

                                                                  
The function is just a vehicle for discussion within welfare economics. Several
speciﬁc welfare functions have been proposed and we will deal with some of
them in later sections. For example, the classical utilitarian welfare function
states that welfare is simply the sum u(p1) + u(p2) + … + u(pn) of all individual
well-being.
<!--l. 15--><p class="indent" >   I introduce these welfare functions because they are precise formalizations of
competing ethical beliefs. In the ﬁrst two objections, I will make use of them in
order to demonstrate that when we assume certain ethical intuitions, the
argument against neutrality does not hold. I will assume various widespread
competing beliefs – average utilitarianism, the diﬀerence principle, and the
median principle – and try to refute the argument against neutrality from
each of these views. The idea is that many people will adhere to one
of these principles so that they can agree with at least one of the
refutations. The third objection is of a diﬀerent kind because, rather
than to the various beliefs about welfare functions, it relates to their
justiﬁcation.
<!--l. 17--><p class="indent" >   Welfare economics are blind in a certain respect, and so will be
this discussion: They are consequentialist. This means that they only
evaluate actions by their outcome and in this context speciﬁcally by their
impact on general welfare or goodness. Other elements of ethical
evaluation, such as the procedural requirements of justice, will have to
be considered separately (cf. Broome 2005, p. 401; Broome 2012, p.
99f). These separate considerations will often require consequentialist
considerations as their basis, so this discussion may also be indirectly relevant
for them.
   <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2.2    </span> <a 
 id="x1-50002.2"></a>The intuition of neutrality</h3>
<!--l. 3--><p class="noindent" >The intuition of neutrality is assumed to be a widespread ethical intuition
among humans (Broome 2012, p. 176f). The content of the intuition is also
                                                                  

                                                                  
called the principle of equal existence (Broome 2004, p. 146). The
following is the content of the deﬁnition: Let us assume two hypothetical
scenarios A and B. The same people exist in both scenarios, except that in
scenario B there are some additional people which do not exist in
scenario A. The intuition says that which one of the scenarios is better
depends entirely on the well-being of the people who exist in both
scenarios and not at all on the additional people who only exist in B –
as long as all the additional people in B have a well-being within a
certain neutral range. More speciﬁcally, as long as the additional
people in B are within the neutral range, scenario A is better in terms of
welfare if the people who exist in both populations have a higher
welfare in scenario A, and scenario B is better in terms of welfare if the
people who exist in both populations have a higher welfare in scenario
B.
<!--l. 5--><p class="indent" >   We can formalize the scenarios as diﬀerent welfare distributions uA and uB.
Let P0 be a population of people who exist in both scenarios but need not
have the same levels of well-being in both scenarios. Let P+ be the
population of people who exist only in scenario B. Let [u1, u2] be the neutral
range of well-being for added people.
<!--l. 7--><p class="indent" >   Deﬁnition 2: The intuition of neutrality
<!--l. 16--><p class="indent" >   This formal deﬁnition is to be interpreted in the following way: It does not
matter in terms of welfare whether there exists an additional person in the
population who lives at a moderate level of well-being. There are
several moderate levels of well-beings, which form a range between a
low moderate level of well-being u1 and a high moderate level of
well-being u2. If however the additional person is at a very low level of
well-being – below u1 – then the person might matter for the calculation of
general well-being. (Arguably, the welfare would decrease because
of the added person; though this is not speciﬁed by the intuition.)
Similarly, if the additional person is at a very high level of well-being –
                                                                  

                                                                  
above u2 – then the person might matter for the calculation of general
well-being. (Arguably, the welfare would increase because of the added
person.)
<!--l. 18--><p class="indent" >   An exemplary application of the intuition is the evaluation of road safety
(Broome 2004, p. 144f). In this context, the deaths of people dying in
accidents must be weighed against the costs of preventing them. Whilst this is
an ethically diﬃcult problem on its own, one important long-term eﬀect is
usually left aside: The well-being of the expected potential oﬀspring of the
potentially dying person is completely neglected. One possible justiﬁcation is
the intuition of neutrality: We can expect the oﬀspring to live within the
neutral range of well-being and it is therefore neither positive nor negative
whether they exist or not.
<!--l. 20--><p class="indent" >   Another example is the evaluation of diﬀerent scenarios of global warming
(Broome 2012, p. 170). Global warming is likely to kill many people and
thereby to prevent their oﬀspring from existing. On the other hand, global
warming may increase poverty, which is associated with higher birth
rates. Thanks to the intuition of neutrality we can simply leave both of
these eﬀects aside in many of our evaluations – which comes handy
as predictions in these domains attend to an enormous amount of
uncertainty.
<!--l. 22--><p class="indent" >   It is important to understand that the intuition of neutrality does not imply
neutrality about the consequences on the existing population which are
caused by the additional population. These consequences may be negative
or positive, leading to contrary political reactions such as China’s restrictive
one-child-policy and Europe’s reproduction-promoting policy (Broome 2012,
p. 169). The consequences on the existing population may well determine
whether additional people are good or not. Only the well-being of the
additional people themselves does not do so according to the intuition of
neutrality.
<!--l. 24--><p class="indent" >   The question whether the intuition of neutrality is in fact a widespread
intuition among humans appears not to have been investigated. It is not
                                                                  

                                                                  
necessary for the argument against neutrality to assume such an empirical
fact. Neither is it necessary for the refutation of this argument to assume so. If
however this refutation were successful and the integrity of the intuition thus
restored, then it would be desirable to investigate the empirical prevalence
of the intuition.
   <h3 class="sectionHead"><span class="titlemark">2.3    </span> <a 
 id="x1-60002.3"></a>The argument against neutrality</h3>
<!--l. 3--><p class="noindent" >The argument against neutrality (Broome 2012, p. 177f., where the ﬁgure
below is also copied from) concludes that the intuition of neutrality is
inconsistent. The argument is a version of the mere addition paradox (Broome
2004, p. 148) and a modiﬁcation of the adoption problem (Broome 2004, p.
161). It is based on the following counter-example to the intuition of
neutrality:
<div class="center"

<!--l. 5--><p class="noindent" >
<!--l. 6--><p class="noindent" ><img 
src="3-fig-1.png" alt="PIC"  
width="276" height="276" ></div>
<!--l. 9--><p class="indent" >   There are three scenarios A, B and C. They share the same population,
except that one additional person exists in both B and C. In both B and C the
additional person has a level of well-being within the neutral range. The
argument is structured into two major steps:
<!--l. 11--><p class="indent" >   First, scenario A is being compared to scenario B and to scenario C. The
additional person can be neglected in this step because the person is within
the neutral range. There is one person who is a little bit better oﬀ in scenario B
than in scenario A. As all other persons have exactly the same level of
well-being, it is reasonable that there is a higher welfare in scenario B
than in scenario A. Contrarily, there is one person who is a little bit
                                                                  

                                                                  
worse oﬀ in scenario C than in scenario A. As all other persons have
exactly the same level of well-being, it is reasonable that there is a
higher welfare in scenario A than in scenario C. As a consequence of
these two observations, scenario B has a higher welfare than scenario
C. Technically, this conclusion requires transitivity of the betterness
relation.
<!--l. 13--><p class="indent" >   Second, scenario B is compared directly to scenario C. Both scenarios
comprise the same people, so there is no additional person in either scenario
who could be neglected. The person who is not present in scenario A and
has therefore been neglected above is much better oﬀ in scenario C than in
scenario B. This big diﬀerence clearly outweighs the diﬀerence of the other
person’s well-being in favour of scenario B. As there is moreover a
higher equality in scenario C, scenario C obviously has a higher welfare
than scenario B. This is in contradiction to the result of step one, so the
counter-example refutes the intuition of neutrality, which has been its core
assumption.
<!--l. 15--><p class="indent" >   Whilst the argument above is intuitively plausible, it has two other
important premises (Broome 2012, p. 177f): First, if in two scenarios all persons
have the same level of well-being except for one person who is better oﬀ in
the second scenario, then the welfare in the second scenario is higher than in
the ﬁrst. Technically, the second scenario Pareto dominates the ﬁrst (Osborne
1997). Second, if in two scenarios with the same population the sum of
individual well-being is higher in the second scenario, and at the same time
the inequality of the distribution of well-being is lower in the second scenario,
then the second scenario is better in terms of welfare than the ﬁrst.
I call this the fair aggregation principle. There are various ways to
measure inequality, and the details need not concern us here. An
excellent survey of one-dimensional inequality measures – as applied in
welfare economics – is given in Sen &amp; Foster 1997. The most prominent
inequality measure is probably the Gini coeﬃcient (see Ceriani &amp;
Verme 2012). Both of these premises appear to be very plausible, and
                                                                  

                                                                  
they are dubbed “hard-to-doubt assumptions” in Broome 2012, p.
176.
<!--l. 17--><p class="indent" >   The following formalization concisely sums up the argument presented
above. It is structured in technical premises (P...), the assumptions that make
up the setting of the counter-example (A...), and the conclusions drawn
(C...). We can infer from the contradiction in (C8) that at least one of the
premises and assumptions must be false. The assumptions merely describe the
setting of the scenarios as depicted in the ﬁgure above. They are simply the
assumptions making up the counter-example and there is no reason to doubt
them within this proof. Moreover, premises (P2) and (P3) appear to be very
plausible. As a consequence, the intuition of neutrality must be the false
premise.
<!--l. 19--><p class="indent" >   Proof 1: The argument against neutrality
<!--l. 52--><p class="indent" >   There are two implications if this argument holds and the intuition of
neutrality is inconsistent (cf. Broome 2005, p. 411): First, we as a society
would have to develop a diﬀerent, consistent principle to replace the
intuition. We do not even currently know whether population changes
should be evaluated as positive or as negative, just that they cannot
simply be evaluated as neutral. The ﬁnding of a new principle with
wide acceptance would certainly present a major societal task and
require many years of discourse. Second, we would need to gain
better knowledge of which actions lead to which consequences with
respect to population changes. Only then would we probably be
able to apply a principle which is not based on neutrality. This requires
new scientiﬁc analysis and simulation because such predictions have
often been omitted in the past (Broome 2005, p. 402; Broome 2012, p.
115f).

<!--l. 56--><p class="noindent" >The transitivity of the betterness relation is plausibly defended in Broome
2004, p. 151f. I will pursue a somewhat related approach to (b) and
(c), focused more on justiﬁcation, in the third objection. The second
objection will be very similar to what is developed in (d) but it will
also be compatible with (e). Whilst (P1) is discussed in (a), (P2) and

<!--l. 4--><p class="noindent" >I will start by delivering some general criticism on Pareto domination and
aggregation and then continue to examine their relation to justice-oriented
welfare functions.
<!--l. 6--><p class="indent" >   When we say that a scenario Pareto dominates another scenario, we
mean that at least one person is better oﬀ in this scenario than in the other
while all other persons are at an equal level of well-being. The Pareto
principle I have formulated as (P2) says that in such cases the scenario has a
higher welfare than the other one. This principle, as well as the extending
requirement of Pareto eﬃciency (cf. Osborne 1997), ﬁnd their due place in
economics where the objective is the eﬃcient allocation of scarce resources
(Samuelson &amp; Nordhaus 2010, p. 4). However I doubt that they are
suitable as ethical principles. Pareto eﬃciency has been criticized
because the liberal paradox suggests that it may be incompatible
with procedural elements of liberalism (see Sen &amp; Foster 1997). But I
believe that there is a more general problem with Pareto eﬃciency
and even with Pareto domination: Consider a large population with
one person whose well-being is much higher than the well-being of
the others. Is it ethically desirable – is there a higher welfare – if the
welll-being of this person is increased even more, while the well-being of the
other persons remains the same? This can be intuitively doubted, and
below I show some mildly convincing reasoning in favour of this intuition
(doubt?).
<!--l. 8--><p class="indent" >   A similar criticism applies to what I have called the fair aggregation
principle. The fair aggregation principle is a combination of what I call the
simple aggregation principle – that general welfare is the simple sum of all
individual well-being – with the additional requirement that distributions need
be more equal to have a higher welfare. The principle is non-exhaustive: it
                                                                  

                                                                  
does not tell us anything about populations with a higher sum of well-being
and a lower equality, and it does not tell us anything about populations with
a lower sum of well-being and a higher equality. But that is not a problem,
since such populations do not play a relevant role in the counter-example to
neutrality.
<!--l. 10--><p class="indent" >   The problem (for what?) is that equality must reasonably be a global
criterion, which means that it somehow takes into account the well-being of
every single person. This implies that a small decrease <span 
class="cmmi-10">𝜀 </span>in well-being of the
person who already is worst oﬀ can always be compensated by some large
increase of equality within the rest of the population. This follows because
otherwise the well-being of the worst-oﬀ person would completely determine
the equality – which is not the idea of inequality measures (vs. justice
measures?).
<!--l. 12--><p class="indent" >   (structure: intro, e vs f, e vs d) Now imagine three scenarios, all with the
same people: In scenario D there is some utility distribution with lots of
inequality. The person who is worst oﬀ in scenario D is called p. In scenario E,
the well-being of the worst-oﬀ person from scenario D is decreased by some
very small amount <span 
class="cmmi-10">𝜀</span>. As we have just seen, this can be compensated in terms
of equality by improving the equality within all the other persons to a more or
less drastical amount. Let us assume this has taken place, so that the overall
equality in scenario E is higher than in scenario D. Let us further assume that in
scenario F all people are at the same level of well-being, plus <img 
src="thesis0x.png" alt="𝜀
2"  class="frac" align="middle">. The
general equality has not decreased (maybe even increased) in F
in comparison to E. However the sum of well-being has increased
because the well-being of many persons has been increased by <img 
src="thesis1x.png" alt="𝜀
2"  class="frac" align="middle">
 while the well-being of only one person has been decreased by <img 
src="thesis2x.png" alt="𝜀
2"  class="frac" align="middle">.
As a consequence, both the sum of individual well-being and the
equality are better in F than in D, so according to the fair aggregation
principle there is a higher welfare in F than in D. At the same time,
the worst-oﬀ person in D is even worse oﬀ in F. This seems intuitively
implausible and I will soon (now?) give a more elaborate account of this
                                                                  

                                                                  
implausibility.
<!--l. 14--><p class="indent" >   STRUCTURE!!! 1. pareto stuﬀ, 2. fair aggregation
<!--l. 16--><p class="indent" >   For this objection I will use as a speciﬁc welfare function the diﬀerence
principle. The diﬀerence principle is a concept which is inferred from an
analysis of justice. Its justiﬁcation as the second principle of justice is given
and discussed in Rawls 2005, pp. 3-183. Rivalling average utilitarianism, the
diﬀerence principle is probably the most prominent and most widely
accepted welfare function. In its core formula, the diﬀerence principle states
that diﬀerences from socioeconomic equality are only permitted if they are
to the beneﬁt of the least advantaged (Rawls 2005, p. 302). This is equivalent
to optimizing the status of the least advantaged. The diﬀerence principle
is therefore usually translated to a welfare function where general
welfare is determined only by the well-being of the group with the
lowest level of well-being. (Such translation commits a major error
in ignoring the diﬀerence between primary goods and well-being
as I discuss in Pomerenke 2017, p.12f. – But this does not bear upon
the reasoning here, which is based solely on Pareto comparisons.)
Whilst the diﬀerence principle refers to the least advantaged group –
which makes sense in application – there is no mistake in referring to
the least advantaged person for the sake of theory. Because of its
resemblance to the decision-theoretic rule of minimum maximization, this
formulation of the principle has also been called the Maximin rule.
(Although this labelling has been rightly criticized in Rawls &amp; Kelly 2001, p.
43.)

<!--l. 22--><p class="indent" >   According to the diﬀerence principle in its Maximin version, both Pareto
domination and fair aggregation are false: Imagine that one person who is
not the worst-oﬀ in either scenario is better oﬀ in the ﬁrst scenario than in
the second while all other persons are equally well oﬀ. Then Pareto
domination requires that the ﬁrst scenario has a higher welfare. The
                                                                  

                                                                  
Maximin rule, however, states that both scenarios have the same welfare
because the well-being of the worst-oﬀ person has not changed. And
we have seen above that as a consequence of fair aggregation a
scenario may be evaluated as having a higher welfare even if the
worst-oﬀ person is even worse oﬀ – in strict contradiction to the diﬀerence
principle.
<!--l. 24--><p class="indent" >   But the diﬀerence principle in its Maximin formulation has been designed
with the practical idea in mind that there will seldom or never be a
comparison in which the least advantaged will have the exactly same level
of well-being in both scenarios. Yet for the theoretical case of a such
comparison (unclear why we need it; it is not the case in the above
example!) an extension to the Maximin rule has been developed (cf. Rawls
2005, p. 83): It says that in the case that the least advantaged are at the
same level in both scenarios, the second-least advantaged must be
regarded. And if the second-least advantaged are also at the same level,
then the third-least advantaged must be regarded, and so on. Because it
resembles a lexicographical sorting algorithm, the extended rule is
called the Leximin rule. It is most clearly formulated as a recursive
selection function which outputs the better population of two populations
whose members are sorted in ascending order according to their
well-being:
<!--l. 26--><p class="indent" >   [Warning: Draw object ignored]Deﬁnition 4: Diﬀerence principle /
“Leximin” selection function
<!--l. 36--><p class="indent" >   We can easily observe that – unlike the Maximin rule – the Leximin rule is
compatible with Pareto domination: If all persons are equal in two scenarios
except one who is better oﬀ in the second scenario, then the Leximin
algorithm will proceed from the least advantaged person up to the person
in question. Alternatively, it will proceed up to the person who has
taken the original person’s place in the ordering, because the original
                                                                  

                                                                  
person has moved up a few positions in the ordering. This process
automatically ensures Pareto domination. So at a second glance
at the diﬀerence principle, it does not contradict but indeed rather
support Pareto domination. This is in favour of the argument against
neutrality.
<!--l. 38--><p class="indent" >   The same, however, cannot be said of fair aggregation. We have seen
above that fair aggregation in some cases evaluates distributions as being
better even though the worst-oﬀ person is worse oﬀ. In such a case, the
Leximin algorithm would stop in the ﬁrst iteration and amount to the Maximin
rule. The algorithm would not regard the improved well-being of all the other
persons, because not only the Maximin rule but also the Leximin rule deem all
general improvements irrelevant if they are to the disadvantage of the least
advantaged. So for one major welfare function the “hard-to-doubt” premise
of fair aggregation (P4) is false and the argument against neutrality cannot
succeed.

the neutral range to be a proper range rather than a single level.
Afterwards, I will try to make plausible why we should rather assume a
single neutral level in theory and elucidate how, taking uncertainty into
account, this single neutral level may approach a proper neutral range in
practice.
<!--l. 7--><p class="indent" >   So far, the formalization of the intuition of neutrality involves a neutral
range [u1, u2] without specifying u1 or u2. As per Def. 2, the neutral range
could in fact just be a single number with u1 = u2. But the argument against
neutrality interprets the intuition of neutrality in a way that does not permit
                                                                  

                                                                  
that the neutral range is just a single level of well-being: In order to neutralize
and counter the positive diﬀerence of well-being of person p between
scenarios B and C, the diﬀerence of well-being of person q must be
non-zero and negative. So the neutral range must allow for such a
diﬀerence, because the well-being of q is to be within the neutral
range:
Even if the intuition of neutrality in this form empirically holds as a widespread
intuition, it is still theoretically problematic. One of its implications is for
example that we cannot say that a scenario with many added people
at the highest well-being within the neutral range is better than a
scenario with many added people at the lowest level of well-being. This
implication – that well-being within the neutral range is incomparable – is at
least controversial. But there are more pressing theoretical questions:
What values should u1 and u2 assume? Imagine someone proposed
as a speciﬁcation that u1 should be at the level of well-being of the
person at the top of the lowest 10% in terms of well-being. How should
we respond? How should we know whether that is correct? What
kind of arguments would we have to employ in order to plead for a
higher or lower value? What kind of ethical principle determines the
range?
<!--l. 13--><p class="indent" >   These problems do not arise if we restrict the intuition of neutrality to a
single level of neutral well-being: (structure???) On the one hand, this would
directly invalidate the argument against neutrality and circumvent the
problem of the incomparability of people within the neutral range
which I have just touched upon. On the other hand, there exists an
established ethical theory which justiﬁes the existence of this level and
explains what value it should take. The theory is average utilitarianism
and one kind of justiﬁcation for it is found in Harsanyi 1955. Average
utilitarianism is a highly controversial theory, speciﬁcally but not only when it is
understood as a complete moral theory rather than only a theory of
goodness (cf. Broome 2012, pp. 50-54; Arrhenius, Ryberg, &amp; Tännsjö 2017,
                                                                  

                                                                  
sec 2.1.1; Rawls 2005, pp. 167-175, 572f). But at least it is a consistent
ethical theory which is not only able to account for many other ethical
intuitions but also to answer our quantitative and justiﬁcatory questions
regarding the neutral level of well-being. The welfare function of average
utilitarianism states that general welfare is the average of all individual
well-being:

speciﬁed that not every single added person needs to be at this neutral
level, but rather the average of all added persons needs to be at this
level.

<!--l. 23--><p class="indent" >   [u1, u2]  = u1 = u2  = u0 = w(P)
<!--l. 25--><p class="indent" >   So average utilitarianism provides a response to the argument against
neutrality by modifying the intuition of neutrality and assuming a neutral level
instead of a neutral range. As a result, the intuition is consistent, calculable,
and maybe even justiﬁed (is the latter investigated here or without scope).
Average utilitarianism plays (in this case) a revisionist role, a theory of moral
error (cf. Mackie 1979, p. 35): It tells us to slightly adjust our intuition – to
sharpen it – so that it is consistent in itself and in its relation to other moral
judgments. This is an acceptable, maybe desirable intervention to our
intuitions.
<!--l. 27--><p class="indent" >   Furthermore, this theoretical sharpening would not even necessarily
change our application of the intuition of neutrality. This is because in
practice, uncertainties are attached to all quantities of well-being,
speciﬁcally the neutral value. When I talk of ‘uncertainty’ here, then I refer to
‘measurement uncertainty’ as used in statistics and the quantitative
sciences. The uncertainty in question is quantiﬁable, so in it falls into the
                                                                  

                                                                  
decision-theoretic category of risk and not into the decision-theoretic category
of uncertainty. Measurement uncertainty is a well-developed theory (see
Runge 2007). Unlike the approaches of introducing indeterminacy in
the forms of incommensurateness or vagueness – which are pursued
and discarded as a solution to the argument against neutrality in
Broome 2004, pp. 164-183 – uncertainty does not suﬀer from diﬃcult
problems such as greediness (aha what does that mean? explain it
shortly?).
<!--l. 29--><p class="indent" >   The neutral value is aﬀected by two kinds of uncertainty: The ﬁrst kind of
uncertainty arises from its deﬁnition. Sensitivity analysis of Def. 5 tells us that the
uncertainty of the neutral level is composed of the average uncertainty of
the well-being of all existing people. Second, the level of well-being of any
actual person that is considered to be at the neutral level or not is also
subject to some uncertainty. In both cases, the uncertainty arises from the
diﬃculty to quantify the personal well-being of existing or hypothetical
persons. These uncertainties are not on a theoretical level. On the
theoretical level it has been questioned that such quantiﬁcations
are metaphysically and psychologically possible at all (cf. Harsanyi
1955, pp. 317-319). On the practical level, these quantiﬁcations are de
facto happening (Broome 2004, ch. 9) but there is a great level of
uncertainty attached to them (elaborate on thisin two three sents? its
interesting).
<!--l. 31--><p class="indent" >   Person q from Proof 1 is at diﬀerent levels in scenario A and B. We can
interpret the neutral range as a neutral level u0 = u1 + (u2 - u1) / 2 with an
uncertainty of <span

values of well-being for person q in scenarios A and B are compatible with
the assumption that there is a single neutral level with u0 with an uncertainty
of <span

<!--l. 35--><p class="indent" >   Is doing so just a sophisticated trick? No. The speciﬁc nature of the intuition
of neutrality had not been analysed before. It was a bit rash to conclude from
the rough idea of the intuition of neutrality that it has to be formalized as a
proper range. I have explained that there is at least no obvious possibility of
justifying such a range, and that as a consequence we do not know
how to quantify the range. Average utilitarianism presents a possible
justiﬁcation for a neutral level, and together with uncertainty it can justify
something like a range. Maybe this formal interpretation is even closer
to the original intuition of neutrality than the interpretation as a real
range is. If it is not, there are many reasons that we should adjust our
intuition.

applied only in a particular instance of comparing the welfare of two
scenario: Whenever there are additional persons in one scenario who do not
exist in the other scenario, then we can apply the intuition of neutrality. This
is reﬂected in the conclusions in Proof 1. In (C3) and (C4) we have
used the intuition of neutrality because there is a diﬀerent number
of persons in scenario A than there is in scenarios B and C. But we
have not used the intuition in (C7) because we have been comparing
scenarios B and C, and these scenarios have the same number of
persons: “B and C contain the very same ﬁve people, so in comparing
their values all ﬁve count as existing people.” (Broome 2012, p.177;
this has been marked as potentially problematic in a talk with Stefan
Fischer.)
<!--l. 11--><p class="indent" >   A simple solution to the argument against against neutrality is to deny that

fails: (explain ‘ notation brieﬂy)
This requires a revised version of the intuition of neutrality (P1). The only thing
which is diﬀerent from Def. 2 is that the intuition has been extended to
comparisons of scenarios where the number of persons is the same: (very

<!--l. 30--><p class="indent" >   But while this solution is compelling so far, it brings with it a formal problem.
Thus far, we have not really needed to specify P0 and P+ any more than what
is implicit in Def. 2: P0 is the population which exists in both scenarios and P+ is
the population which exists only in scenario B. This is no longer implicit in
Def. 7: P0 and P+ both exist in both scenarios. (this should probs go
before the deﬁnition) There is no formal way to distinguish them. P+ are
the people who are neutral with respect to general welfare if their
                                                                  

                                                                  
well-being lies within the neutral range. And P+ are the same people in B
and in C. But P+ could be any persons: P+ could be all persons, no
persons, or an arbitrary selection of persons. So as they are not already
formally speciﬁed we need to specify P+. It is obvious how we specify
them:

not a problem. The problem is that it is also a relative deﬁnition. Which people
are existing and which are not depends on the time of evaluation. When we
consider whether it is good or not that a baby is born, we arrive at diﬀerent
evaluations before and after the pregnancy of the baby’s parent. Before the
pregnancy, the baby’s well-being has to be ignored because of the intuition
of neutrality, but after the pregnancy, the baby’s well-being has to
be considered. Imagine that we want to know whether it is positive
or negative for the general welfare whether the baby suﬀers from a
chronic disease. Then before the pregnancy we will derive that the
chronic disease is neutral with respect to general welfare and after the
pregnancy we will derive that it would be better for general welfare if the
baby does not suﬀer from a such disease (is better / would have been
better).

scenario (pp. 68-76). Second, because of the diﬃculty to ethically justify

<!--l. 48--><p class="indent" >   The problem of inconsistency cannot be denied: If ethical evaluations of
welfare depend on the choice of the base scenario and if every person

arise. Principally, there are inconsistencies of several kinds. One person could
contradict another person from the same population. As we are concerned
with population ethics here, where persons will usually somehow consider the
whole population for their evaluation, this is not necessarily a problem. A
necessary problem is the time-dependence of the evaluation, which is
pointed out in Broome 2004, p. 75: “You choose rightly, but it later turns out
you chose wrongly. Indeed, it may turn out that you ought later to undo what
you rightly did. Moreover, you might be able to foresee even as you choose A
that just this would happen. This is a most implausible sort of incoherence in

acceptable.

inconsistency between actions. (This needs SEP backing!!) Such a

concept is very fuzzy and the existing theory of rationality does not
provide a criterion for identifying inconsistent actions. What the theory of
rationality does provide, is a criterion for identifying inconsistent beliefs:
Beliefs are inconsistent if their propositions are contradictory. Without a
formal theory of inconsistent actions, philosophers should probably
                                                                  

                                                                  
restrict themselves to the analysis of inconsistent beliefs, not actions.
(not yet, but why couldn’t there be one?) The underlying beliefs are
complex: Before the action A, we think that we should do A. And we think
that as a causal eﬀect of doing A, we will regret having done A. So
we think that we should do A, and that we will regret it afterwards.
After the action A, we think that we should not have done A. We also
think that we have thought that we should do A. There is no formal
contradiction in these beliefs. It may very well be rational to think A at the
moment and to expect that oneself would think the opposite of A under
diﬀerent circumstances. As the enactment of A causes a change
of circumstances, the above beliefs may come about, and there is
nothing wrong with them. There is also no such thing as a problem of
“undoing” an action in philosophical terms. A is done within one set of
circumstances and then within another set of circumstances is “undone”. The
two actions of “doing A” and “undoing A” can be diﬀerentiated by
the fact that they have taken place within diﬀerent contexts (one
context without the causal eﬀects of A and one context with the causal
eﬀects of A). There is no reason to ignore the contexts of the actions
and to strip them down to the notions of “doing A” and “undoing
A”.
<!--l. 52--><p class="indent" >   Let us examine two examples where we ignore any ethical constraints and
just consider the consistency of their beliefs. Imagine a community of
two persons who reason whether or not they should improve some
genetic condition of their child. They may be concerned about the
well-being of the family and think: “Our family is rather against this for
religious reasons. Once the child is born, it will clearly prefer that the
modiﬁcation had taken place. Our family will then have to respect
the preferences of the child. As a result, our family will think that the
modiﬁcation should have taken place; and if it will not have taken place, our
family will probably be very unhappy about it.” The parents in their
situation of reasoning should then consider whether they want to
                                                                  

                                                                  
experience this later unhappiness. But there is no rule of rationality
which would require them to somehow align the present and future
preferences of the family. After all, the family will consist of diﬀerent
persons after the child is born. As a second example, imagine a direct
democracy called Alphaland whose citizens consider – because of
their liberal ideal – to invade and annex an autocratic country called
Betaland with a population bigger than their own population. They
consensually adopt a resolution: “Alphaland wants to annex Betaland.
Alphaland expects Betaland to condemn the violence related to the
annexation. As the current citizens of Betaland will be the majority in
Alphaland after the annexation, we expect that Alphaland will oﬃcially
regret the annexation afterwards. But we expect that most former
Betaland citizens will nonetheless want to remain in Alphaland for
pragmatic reasons (so there is no reason against the action).” Rationality
does not require present Alphaland to consider the interest future
Alphaland. After all, future Alphaland is made up of diﬀerent citizens
than present Alphaland. These examples illustrate that there is no
requirement for communities to be consistent with their beliefs and
expected beliefs over time. (Whether this principle also applies to
individual agents is up for discussion, but luckily needs not concern us
here.)
