## Abstract

How should we as a society value changes in population size? I defend the intuition of neutrality, which answers a part of the question. It states that – other things being equal – it is ethically irrelevant whether or not additional people are added to a population. The argument against neutrality criticizes the intuition of neutrality as inconsistent.

The contribution of this thesis is twofold: First, the framework of welfare economics, the intuition of neutrality, and the argument against neutrality are presented with formal rigour. Second, the formalizations are used for a critical analysis of the argument against neutrality. Three ethical frameworks are assumed – the difference principle, average utilitarianism, and contractarianism –, and their relations to the explicit and hidden premises of the argument against neutrality are investigated.

As a result, the intuition of neutrality can be assumed in these frameworks. Whether the intuition of neutrality should be adopted is left open in this thesis. Assuming that ethics is a system which should be built up from people’s ethical convictions (a controversial claim on its own), an investigation into the empirical prevalence of the intuition should be conducted. If the intuition of neutrality is considered correct, it might simplify calculations with regard to pressing problems such as global warming.

## Errors

Some errors that have been pointed out after the thesis was finished:

- Section 2.2, while correct, is irrelevant to the argument that the thesis makes: The argument against neutrality can also be constructed using the difference principle rather than the principle of fair aggregation.
- Section 2.3 contains some errors regarding the status of metaethical relativism and of contractarianism.
- The intuition of neutrality may not be as relevant for climate policy as it is assumed in the thesis. Many thanks to Jacob Rosenthal for insisting on this issue. If you research this topic, make sure you understand its applicability first.

## Additional Literature

Relevant literature published after this thesis was written.

  - A very clear overview over population ethics, and over its connection to climate policy (as it is assumed in Broome 2004, Broome 2012, and in this thesis); a generalization of various welfare functions; an argument that policy decisions on climate change might not depend on population ethics because the relevant welfare functions might agree in the corner case. The argument is probably independent from the argument in this thesis, but one main conclusion can be derived from both arguments: The worry based on the argument against neutrality is unfounded.
