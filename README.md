### Introduction

How should we as a society value changes in population size? The
question may be crucial when evaluating global warming scenarios. I
defend the intuition of neutrality, which answers a part of the
question. It states that – other things being equal – it is ethically
irrelevant whether or not additional people are added to a population.
The argument against neutrality criticizes the intuition of neutrality
as inconsistent.

The contribution of this thesis is twofold: First, the framework of
welfare economics, the intuition of neutrality, and the argument against
neutrality will be presented with formal rigour. Second, the formalizations
will be used for a critical analysis of the argument against neutrality.
Three ethical frameworks will be assumed – the difference principle,
average utilitarianism, and contractarianism –, and their relation to
the explicit and hidden premises of the argument against neutrality will
be investigated.

The result will be that all three frameworks are compatible with the
intuition of neutrality (or slightly modified versions); so the argument
against neutrality does not hold within them.

The analysis is built on several controversial philosophical views and
does not necessarily disprove the argument against neutrality. Rather,
it undermines the authority of the argument by pointing out the weakness
of several premises within the three frameworks.

I begin by briefly introducing the framework of welfare economics, which
this essay argues within. I then present in more detail the intuition of
neutrality and the formal argument brought forward against it. The main
part is dedicated to the development of three lines of argumentation in
opposition to the argument against neutrality (thus defending the
intuition of neutrality). I conclude with a systematic summary of the
three lines of argumentation.

### Conclusion

This thesis has formally presented the framework of welfare economics,
the intuition of neutrality, and the argument against (the intuition of)
neutrality. It has proceded by critically analyzing the impact of three
(meta)ethical frameworks on the soundness of the argument against
neutrality, with the following results:

1.  The difference principle in its Leximin formulation is in
    contradiction to the principle of fair aggregation, which is a
    premise for the argument against neutrality. The argument against
    neutrality therefore does not hold when assuming the difference
    principle.

2.  The argument against neutrality has the implicit premise that the
    neutral range within which persons can be added to a population is a
    proper range. Average utilitarianism suggests to slightly modify the
    intuition of neutrality so that it uses a neutral level rather than
    a proper neutral range. Because of the uncertainty involved, this is
    in practice somewhat similar to the original intuition of
    neutrality. The argument against neutrality therefore does not hold
    when assuming average utilitarianism and slightly adjusting the
    intuition of neutrality accordingly.

3.  Assuming metaethical time-relativism (as is usually the case in
    contractarian theories), the intuition of neutrality can be modified
    by introducing a base scenario for comparisons. This modification is
    in line with the spirit of the original intuition of neutrality. The
    argument against neutrality does not hold when assuming this
    modification.

This means that in any of the three frameworks – difference principle,
average utilitarianism, implementations of metaethical relativism such
as moral contractarianism – the argument against neutrality does not
hold. These frameworks do not present a complete partition of ethical
beliefs, but they are major ethical frameworks.

As a result, the intuition of neutrality *can* be assumed in these
frameworks. Whether the intuition of neutrality *should* be adopted is
left open in this thesis. Assuming that ethics is a system which should
be built up from people’s ethical convictions (a controversial claim on
its own), an investigation into the empirical prevalence of the
intuition should be conducted. If the intuition of neutrality is
considered correct, it might simplify calculations with regard to
pressing problems such as global warming.
