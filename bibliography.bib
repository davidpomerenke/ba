Theycould be policies, public projects, candidates in an election,distributions of income and labour requirements among the members of asociety, or just about anything else. There are some people whosepreferences will inform this choice, and the question is: whichprocedures are there for deriving, from what is known or can be foundout about their preferences, a collective or “social”ordering of the alternatives from better to worse? The answer isstartling. Arrow's theorem says there are no such procedureswhatsoever—none, anyway, that satisfy certain apparently quitereasonable assumptions concerning the autonomy of the people and therationality of their preferences. The technical framework in whichArrow gave the question of social orderings a precise sense and itsrigorous answer is now widely used for studying problems in welfareeconomics. The impossibility theorem itself set much of the agenda forcontemporary social choice theory. Arrow accomplished this while stilla graduate student. In 1972, he received the Nobel Prize in economicsfor his contributions.},

	abstract = {In Derek Parfit’s original formulation the Repugnant Conclusionis stated as follows: “For any possible population of at leastten billion people, all with a very high quality of life, there mustbe some much larger imaginable population whose existence, if otherthings are equal, would be better even though its members have livesthat are barely worth living” (Parfit 1984). The RepugnantConclusion highlights a problem in an area of ethics which has becomeknown as population ethics. The last three decades havewitnessed an increasing philosophical interest in questions such as“Is it possible to make the world a better place by creatingadditional happy people?” and “Is there a moral obligationto have children?” The main problem has been to find an adequatetheory about the moral value of states of affairs where the number ofpeople, the quality of their lives (or their life-time welfare orwell-being - we shall use these terms interchangeably here), and theiridentities may vary. Since, arguably, any reasonable moral theory hasto take these aspects of possible states of affairs into account whendetermining the normative status of actions, the study of populationethics is of general import for moral theory. As the name indicates,Parfit finds the Repugnant Conclusion unacceptable and manyphilosophers agree. However, it has been surprisingly difficult tofind a theory that avoids the Repugnant Conclusion without implyingother equally counterintuitive conclusions. Thus, the question as tohow the Repugnant Conclusion should be dealt with and, more generally,what it shows about the nature of ethics has turned the conclusioninto one of the cardinal challenges of modern ethics.},

Second, we seem to have strong moral reason to improve the wellbeing of existing lives, but, again, no moral reason to create lives that are worth living. Both asymmetries have proven very difficult to account for in any coherent moral framework. I propose an impersonal population axiology to underpin the asymmetries, which sidesteps the problematic issue of whether or not people can be harmed or benefited by creation or non-creation. This axiology yields perfect asymmetry from a deliberative perspective, in terms of expected value. The axiology also yields substantial asymmetry for large and realistic populations in terms of their actual value, beyond deliberative relevance.},

Cost‐benefit analysts traditionally ignore these effects because they think that changes in the population are ethically neutral: neither benefits or costs. Although this view is intuitively plausible, it is false for theoretical reasons. There can be only one neutral level of lifetime well‐being. Adding to the population a person whose well‐being would be below this level is bad. However, this single neutral level might be very vague, which means that over a large range of levels of well‐being, adding a person at that level is neither determinately good nor determinately bad. This helps to restore the view that changing the population is generally ethically neutral. But neutrality of this sort turns out to have incredible implications for cost‐benefit analysis.},

	abstract = {This dissertation provides a defense of the normative intuition known as the Procreation Asymmetry, according to which there is a strong moral reason not to create a life that will foreseeably not be worth living, but there is no moral reason to create a life just because it would foreseeably be worth living.  
Chapter 1 investigates how to reconcile the Procreation Asymmetry with our intuitions about another recalcitrant problem case in population ethics: Derek Parfit's Non-Identity Problem. I show that what has prevented philosophers from developing a theory that gives a satisfactory account of both these problems is their tacit commitment to a teleological conception of well-being, as something to be `promoted'. Replacing this picture with one according to which our reasons to confer well-being on people are conditional on their existence allows me to do better. It also enables us to understand some of the deep structural parallels between seemingly disparate normative phenomena such as procreating and promising. 
Chapter 2 attempts to connect my defense of the Procreation Asymmetry to corresponding evaluative claims about the goodness of the outcomes produced by procreative decisions. I propose a view, the `biconditional buck-passing view of outcome betterness', according to which facts about the comparative goodness of outcomes are a function of our reasons for bringing about one outcome rather than another under certain conditions. This enables me to derive an Evaluative Procreation Asymmetry from the corresponding normative claims established in Chapter 1. The biconditional buck-passing view also provides me with a principled basis for challenging a version of the Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives Principle. This, in turn, permits me to provide a novel solution to another famous problem in population ethics: Parfit's Mere Addition Paradox. 
Finally, in Chapter 3, I rebut some key objections to the Procreation Asymmetry by showing that upholding it does not commit us to anti-natalism and that it is compatible with a moral concern for the long-term survival of humanity.},
